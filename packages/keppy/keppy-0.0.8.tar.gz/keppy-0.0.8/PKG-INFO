Description: KEP.py
        ===
        
        A Python parser of Kepware projects.
        
        # Overview
        
        KEP.py parses the .json files exportable from the KEPServerEX
        Configuration client.
        
        To use, read the contents of the .json file into a dictionary. Then,
        create a `Project` object and pass it the dictionary.
        
        From that project object, you can now get all of the channels of the
        project and so on. The full list of the hierarchy you can reach is as
        follows:
        
        
            Channel
            └─Device 
              ├─Register (See simulator device)
              └─Tag Group(s)
                ├─tag1
                ├─tag2
                ...
