def bonds_from_distance(system, fudge=1.2):
    """
    Creates edges between nodes of molecules in system based on a distance
    criterion. Nodes in system must have `position` and `element` attributes.
    The possible distance between nodes is determined by values in
    `VDW_RADII`.

    Notes
    -----
    Elements that are not in `VDW_RADII` do not make bonds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system: :class:`~vermouth.system.System`
        The system in which to add edges.
    fudge: :class:`~numbers.Number`
        Increase the allowed distance by this factor.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`networkx.Graph`
        A new graph where edges are added between nodes that are within a
        certain distance from each other. It is probably disconnected.
