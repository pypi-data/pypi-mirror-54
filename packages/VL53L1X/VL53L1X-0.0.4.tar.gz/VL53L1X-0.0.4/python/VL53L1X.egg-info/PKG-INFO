        ```python
        import VL53L1X
        
        tof = VL53L1X.VL53L1X(i2c_bus=1, i2c_address=0x29)
        tof.open() # Initialise the i2c bus and configure the sensor
        tof.start_ranging(1) # Start ranging, 1 = Short Range, 2 = Medium Range, 3 = Long Range
        distance_in_mm = tof.get_distance() # Grab the range in mm
        tof.stop_ranging() # Stop ranging
