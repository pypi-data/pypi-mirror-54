# Introduction

Hypermax is a power tool for optimizing algorithms. It builds on the powerful TPE algorithm with additional features
meant to help you get to your optimal hyper parameters faster and easier. We call our algorithm Adaptive-TPE, and it is
fast and accurate optimizer that trades off between explore-style and exploit-style strategies in an intelligent manner
based on your results. It depends upon pretrained machine learning models that have been taught how to optimize
your machine learning model as fast as possible. Read the research behind ATPE in [Optimizing Optimization](https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/optimizing-optimization) and [Learning to Optimize](https://www.electricbrain.io/blog/learning-to-optimize), and use it for yourself by downloading Hypermax.

In addition, Hypermax automatically gives you a variety of charts and graphs based on your hyperparameter results.
Hypermax can be restarted easily in-case of a crash. Hypermax can monitor the CPU and RAM usage of your algorithms - 
automatically killing your process if it takes too long to execute or uses too much RAM. Hypermax even has a UI.
Hypermax makes it easier and faster to get to those high performing hyper-parameters that you crave so much.

# Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip3 install hypermax -g
```

Python3 is required.

# Getting Started (Using Python Library)

In Hypermax, you define your hyper-parameter search, including the variables, method of searching, and 
loss functions, using a JSON object as you configuration file.


# Getting Started (Using CLI)

Here is an example. Lets say you have the following file, model.py:

```python
import sklearn.datasets
import sklearn.ensemble
import sklearn.metrics
import datetime

def trainModel(params):
    inputs, outputs = sklearn.datasets.make_hastie_10_2()

    startTime = datetime.now()

    model = sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=int(params['n_estimators']))
    model.fit(inputs, outputs)
    predicted = model.predict(inputs)

    finishTime = datetime.now()

    auc = sklearn.metrics.auc(outputs, predicted)

    return {"loss": auc, "time": (finishTime - startTime).total_seconds()}
```

You configure your hyper parameter search space by defining a JSON-schema object with the needed values:

```json
{
    "hyperparameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "n_estimators": {
                "type": "number",
                "min": 1,
                "max": 1000,
                "scaling": "logarithmic"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Next, define how you want to execute your optimization function:

```json
{
    "function": {
        "type": "python_function",
        "module": "model.py",
        "name": "trainModel",
        "parallel": 1
    }
}
```

Next, you need to define your hyper parameter search:

```json
{
    "search": {
        "method": "atpe",
        "iterations": 1000
    }
}
```

Next, setup where you wants results stored and if you want
graphs generated:


```json
{
    "results": {
        "directory": "results",
        "graphs": true
    }
}
```


Lastly, you need to provide indication if you want to use the UI:

```json
{
    "ui": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

**NOTE:** At the moment the console UI is not supported in Windows environments, so you will need to specify `false` in
the `enabled` property. We use the `urwid.raw_display` module which relies on `fcntl`. For more information, [see here](https://github.com/urwid/urwid/issues/152).

Pulling it all together, you create a file like this `search.json`, defining your hyper-parameter search:

```json
{
    "hyperparameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "n_estimators": {
                "type": "number",
                "min": 1,
                "max": 1000,
                "scaling": "logarithmic"
            }
        }
    },
    "function": {
        "type": "python_function",
        "module": "model",
        "name": "trainModel",
        "parallel": 1
    },
    "search": {
        "method": "atpe",
        "iterations": 1000
    },
    "results": {
        "directory": "results",
        "graphs": true
    },
    "ui": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

And now you can run your hyper-parameter search

```bash
$ hypermax search.json
```

Hypermax will automatically begin searching your hyperparameter space. If your computer dies and you need to restart
your hyperparameter search, its as easy as providing it the existing results directory as a second parameter. Hypermax
will automatically pick up where it left off.

```bash
$ hypermax search.json results_0/
```

# Optimization Algorithms

Hypermax supports 4 different optimization algorithms:

 - "random" - Does a fully random search
 - "tpe" - The classic TPE algorithm, with its default configuration
 - "atpe" - Our Adaptive-TPE algorithm, a good general purpose optimizer 
 - "abh" - Adaptive Bayesian Hyperband - this is an optimizer that its able to learn from partially trained algorithms in order to optimizer your fully trained algorithm

The first three optimizers - random, tpe, and atpe, can all be used with no configuration. 

## Adaptive Bayesian Hyperband

The only optimizer in our toolkit that requires additional configuration is the Adaptive Bayesian Hyperband algorithm.

ABH works by training your network with different amounts of resources. Your "Resource" can be any parameter that significantly effects
the execution time of your model. Typically, training-time, size of dataset, or # of epochs are used as the resource. The amount of resource
is referred to as the "budget" of a particular execution.

By using partially trained networks, ABH is able to explore more widely over more combinations of hyperparameters, and then triage
the knowledge it gains up to the fully trained model. It does this by using a tournament of sorts, promoting the best performing 
parameters on smaller budget runs to be trained at larger budgets. See the following chart as an example:

![Hyperband CPU Allocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electricbrainio/hypermax/master/docs/abh_cpu_allocation.png "Single Parameter Loss Chart")

There are many ways you could configure such a system. Hyperband is just a mathematically and theoretically sound way of choosing
how many brackets to run and with what budgets. ABH is a method that combines Hyperband with ATPE, in the same way that BOHB combines
Hyperband with conventional TPE.

ABH requires you to select three additional parameters:
- min_budget - Sets the minimum amount of resource that must be allocated to a single run
- max_budget - Sets the maximum amount of resource that can be allocated to a single run
- eta - Defines how much the budget is reduced for each bracket. The theoretically optimum value is technically E or 2.71, but values of 3 or 4 are more typical and work fine in practice.

You define these parameters like so:

```json
{
  "search": {
      "method": "abh",
      "iterations": 1000,
      "min_budget": 1,
      "max_budget": 30,
      "eta": 3
  }
}
```

This configuration will result in Hyperband testing 4 different brackets: 30 epochs, 10 epochs, 3.333 epochs (rounded down), and 1.1111 epochs (rounded down)

The budget for each run is provided as a hyperparameter to your function, along side your other hyperparameters. The budget will be given as 
the "$budget" key in the Python dictionary that is passed to your model function.

Tips:
 - ABH only works well when the parameters for a run with a small budget correlates strongly with the parameters for a run with a high budget.
 - Try to eliminate any parameters whose behaviour and effectiveness might change depending on the budget. E.g. a parameter for % of budget in mode 1, % of budget in mode 2 will not
   work well with ABH. 
 - Don't test too wide of a range of budgets. As a general rule of thumb, never set min_budget lower then max_budget/eta^4
 - Never test a min_budget thats so low that your model doesn't train at all. The minimum is there for a reason
 - If you find that ABH is getting stuck in a local minima, choosing parameters that work well on few epochs but work poorly on many epochs, your 
   better off using vanilla ATPE and just training networks fully on each run.


# Results

Hypermax automatically generates a wide variety of different types of results for you to analyze.

## Hyperparameter Correlations

The hyperparameter correlations can be viewed from within the user-interface or in "correlations.csv" within
your results directory. The correlations can help you tell which hyper-parameter combinations are moving the
needle the most. Remember that a large value either in the negative or positive indicates a strong correlation
between those two hyper-parameters. Values close to 0 indicate that there is little correlation between those
hyper-parameters. The diagonal access will give you the single-parameter correlations.

It should also be noted that these numbers get rescaled to fall roughly between -10 and +10 (preserving the original sign),
and thus are not the mathematically defined covariances. This is done to make it easier to see the important relationships.

## Single Parameter Loss Charts

![Single Parameter Loss Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electricbrainio/hypermax/master/docs/single_parameter_scatter.png "Single Parameter Loss Chart")

The single parameter loss charts create a Scatter diagram between the parameter and the loss. These are the most useful charts and are usually the go-to for attempting
to interpret the results. Hypermax is going to generate several different versions of this chart. The original version will have every tested value. The "bucketed"
version will attempt to combine hyper-parameter values into "buckets" and give you the minimum value for each bucket - useful for continuous valued hyper-parameters
that you have a lot of results for. The "top_10_percent" version is just showing you the scatter for only the top-10% of results - useful when you want to home in on
those top-performing values.

You will also get a version of this chart for the time that your model takes to execute. This can be useful if trading off between accuracy and time taken is important
to you.

## Two Parameter Loss Matrix

The two parameter loss matrixes are a color-coded diagram that helps you to determine the optimal value between two hyper-parameters.

![Two Parameter Loss Matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electricbrainio/hypermax/master/docs/loss_matrix.png "Loss Matrix")

The graph is color coded in the following way:

    Red: 90th percentile of squares
    Yellow: 40th percentile of squares
    Green: 20th percentile of squares
    Blue: 5th percentile of squares

We use quadric interpolation which both gives nice smooth rounded corners but does not excessively blur key areas. Thee chart is generated by
dividing your hyperparameter values into 10 buckets each, resulting in a 10x10 grid of squares. We compute a value for each square in two ways:

One version of the graph computes the value for each square by taking the Min of all values in that grid square. This is usually the most useful
chart. The other version computes the value by taking the Mean. This second version can be susceptible to outlier results, but can show interesting
patterns sometimes.

You also get versions of this graph done which only use the top 10% of your results, helping you to further focus in on the top performing area of
your hyper parameter space. In addition, you get a version of this matrix done for the execution time of your model - in caes that is important.

## Two Parameter Response Matrix

The response matrixes are very similar to the Loss matrices. In fact - it displays all of the same data. They are just color-coded differently
to highlight different things. The Loss matrix defines its colors based on global statistics. The Response Matrix defines its colors
based only one the values within each row. This often highlights important patterns - such as that the optimal value for one hyperparameter
is always the same, regardless of the other hyper parameter (like this chart below, where optimal boosting_rounds appears to be around 40, no 
matter what the max_depth is.)

![Two Parameter Response Matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electricbrainio/hypermax/master/docs/response_matrix.png "Response Matrix")

The graph is color coded in the following way:

    Red: 90th percentile of row
    Yellow: 60th percentile of row
    Green: 30th percentile of row
    Blue: 10th percentile of row

## Two Parameter Scatter

The two parameter scatters go along-side the two-parameter loss matrices. If you are concerned that the Loss Matrixes may be trying to extrapolate too
much from very few data-points, you can check the scatter in order to check if you actually have a decent sample of results that fall within that area.

![Two Parameter Scatter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electricbrainio/hypermax/master/docs/two_parameter_scatter.png "Two Parameter Scatter")

The color coding is the same as it is for the Loss Matrix, but percentiles are calculated over all results and not over the 10x10 grid of squares.

    Red: 90th percentile of values
    Yellow: 40th percentile of values
    Green: 20th percentile of values
    Blue: 5th percentile of values

The size of the markers will also vary - larger and bluer is more accurate. Smaller and redder is less accurate.

## CSV Files

For all of the above mentioned charts, you will automatically get CSV files containing all of the raw data used to generate that chart.

# Detailed Configuration

## Hyper Parameter Space

You define your hyper-parameter space within the "hyperparameters" section of the configuration file. The format is reminiscent of JSON-schema, however, only
a limited set of options are supported.

### Number hyper-parameters

Most of the hyper-parameters that you are going to be tuning are expected to be numbers. The configuration of the number hyper-parameter looks like so:

```json
{
    "parameter_name": {
        "type": "number",
        "mode": "uniform",
        "scaling": "logarithmic",
        "min": 1,
        "max": 1000,
        "rounding": 1
    }
}
```

There are 3 required parameters - type, min and max. Type should be set to 'number', and the min and max should represent the minimum and maximum values of
your range.

There are also three optional parameters. `mode` can be either `uniform` or `normal` (defaults to `uniform`). The `scaling` parameter can be either `linear`
or `logarithmic` (default to `linear`). And you can additionally set `rounding` if you want values to be rounded to some fixed interval. A rounding set to 1
will make your parameter an integer.


### Enumerations

When you have several different possible values that are categorically distinct, you can use an enumeration to specify the possible options:

```json
{
    "activation_function": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["relu", "elu", "tanh", "sigmoid", "swish", "prelu", "selu"]
    }
}
```


### Object hyper-parameters

Your hyper-parameter space can contain JSON objects which contain other hyper parameters. In fact, the bottom layer must be made as an object. Simply
set the type to `object` and provide it a `properties` field.

```json
{
    "parameter_object": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "parameter_name": {
                "type": "number",
                "mode": "uniform",
                "scaling": "logarithmic",
                "min": 1,
                "max": 1000,
                "rounding": 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Choices & Decision Points

The true power of the TPE algorithm comes from its ability to optimize categorical hyper-parameters, including ones which make other hyper-parameters
available. To do this, you can provide either a `oneOf` or `anyOf` field. Note that "oneOf" and "anyOf" behave exactly the same - we allow
both in order to match JSON-Schema specifications.


```json
{
    "choice_parameter": {
        "anyOf": [
            {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "parameter_name": {
                        "type": "number",
                        "min": 1,
                        "max": 1000
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "other_parameter_name": {
                        "type": "number",
                        "min": 1,
                        "max": 1000
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Hypermax will add in an additional "parameter_name.$index" field into the parameters it sends to your algorithm, so that you
can tell which side of the branch you are on.

Important! When using oneOf or anyOf, each of the options MUST be "object" type hyperparameters, as shown above.


### Constants

When using decision points, you may find it convenient to add in a constant value to tell you which side of the branch you are on.

This is easy using a "constant" parameter. You can have the same parameter name on both sides of the branch.

This allows you to, for example, test two different neural network optimizers, and the various learning rates
attached to each, without having to worry that the algorithm is going to learn an "average" learning rate that 
works for both optimizers. Both sides of the branch will be kept separate during optimization, even though
they share the same parameter names.

Constant parameters are ignored for optimization purposes, but are still passed into your function, making them mostly
useful when you want to lock in a parameter without changing your code, or when using decision points like so:

```json
{
    "optimizer": {
        "oneOf": [
            {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "optimizerName": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "constant": "adam"

                    },
                    "learningRate": {
                        "type": "number",
                        "min": 1e-5,
                        "max": 1e-3
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "optimizerName": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "constant": "sgd"

                    },
                    "learningRate": {
                        "type": "number",
                        "min": 1e-5,
                        "max": 1e-3
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


## Model Execution

There are several different ways of executing your model.

### Python Functions

The most straight forward way to execute your model is by defining a Python function. To do this, simply provide the 
name of the module and the name of the function in the "module" and "name" functions, like so:

```json
{
    "function": {
        "type": "python_function",
        "module": "model",
        "name": "trainModel"
    }
}
```

Remember that you do not include the extension of the name of your module, there is no ".py" on it. The module is
referenced using Pythons standard system. This means that you can directly reference any files in the current working
directory simply by their file-name. Alternatively, you can reference a system-package or a Python package that is
setup elsewhere. As long as this works:

```bash
    $ python3

    Python 3.6.5 (default, Mar 29 2018, 18:20:46) 
    [GCC 8.0.1 20180317 (Red Hat 8.0.1-0.19)] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import module_name
    >>> module.foobar()
```

Then this will to:

```json
{
    "function": {
        "type": "python_function",
        "module": "module_name",
        "name": "foobar"
    }
}
```

### Format of the result

The results can be provided in one of two formats. The simplest is to just return the loss directly as a single floating point value
from your cost function, or print it to standard output in your executable. For example:

```python
def trainModel(parameters):
    # Do some fancy stuff
    loss = 1.0
    return loss
```

or as an executable:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Do some fany stuff
loss = 1.0
print(loss)
```

If you are using multiple losses though, you will have to return each of them as part of a JSON object. For example:

```python
def trainModel(parameters):
    # Do some fancy stuff
    accuracy = 0.9
    stddev = 0.1
    return {"accuracy": accuracy, "stddev": stddev}
```

or as an executable:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import json

# Do some fancy stuff
accuracy = 0.9
stddev = 0.1
print(json.dumps({"accuracy": accuracy, "stddev": stddev}))
```

If you want to store additional metadata with your model, you can. Any fields that are unrecognized for any other purpose will be automatically considered as metadata.

```python
def trainModel(parameters):
    # Do some fancy stuff
    loss = 1.0
    additional_statistic = 42.0
    return {"loss": loss, "additional_statistic": additional_statistic}
```

The time your model takes is automatically measured by Hypermax (time can be used for punishing your model for taking too long, see Losses section).
However, you may only care about the execution / run-time of your model, and not about the training time. In these cases, you can return `time` as
an additional variable.

```python
def trainModel(parameters):
    # Do some fancy stuff
    model = Model()
    model.train()
    start = datetime.now()
    loss = model.test()
    end = datetime.now()
    return {"loss": loss, "time": (end-start).total_seconds()}
```

It should be noted that this time is not the same time used for `auto_kill` purposes. This is the time that will be showed in the UI and considered for optimization
purposes.

### Automatically killing models due to running time or RAM usage

Sometimes, your models may be behaving very poorly in certain parts of your hyper-parameter space. It is thus possible,
and indeed recommended, to set add limits on how long your model can be running for and how much RAM it can use. This
prevents your optimization routine from getting hung due to a model that takes too long to train, or crashing entirely
because it uses too much RAM.

To do this, simply add in a `auto_kill_max_time`, `auto_kill_max_ram`, or `auto_kill_max_system_ram` option, and set a 
a `kill_loss` variable to indicate what the loss should be for models which are killed.

auto_kill_max_time is specified in seconds. `auto_kill_max_ram` and `auto_kill_max_system_ram` are both specified in
megabytes, the kind which are based by `1024` (not `1000`).

`auto_kill_max_ram` only measures the RAM of the model process. However, if your cost-function has other various
sub-processes which take up RAM, these will not be counted. Therefore, you can use `auto_kill_max_system_ram` in
these cases to prevent total system RAM usage from creeping too high (the assumption being your model is what is
taking up the systems RAM). You are able to provide both at the same time (if you want to).

`auto_kill_loss` is just a floating point indicating the total loss that should be given to the optimizer when the model
is killed. This helps teach the optimizer to avoid hyper-parameters which lead to models being killed.

```json
{
    "function": {
        "type": "python_function",

## Loss / Cost Functions (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

PLEASE NOTE THIS SECTION IS DESCRIBING FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY AND IS NOT YET SUPPORTED. PLEASE IGNORE THIS SECTION.

We support several different types of cost functions.

## Timing Loss (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

You can include the time your model takes to train as one of your loss functions as well.  This makes it convenient 
to teach the algorithm to avoid bad hyper parameters which lead to long training times. Many algorithms have poor
combinations of parameters which can lead to long execution time with no improvement in performance.

If the algorithm takes less then the `target_time`, then no penalty is incurred. As the time taken goes between
`target_time` and `max_time`, the penalty is introduced quadratically. At `max_time`, the penalty is exactly
`penalty_at_max`.

This usually results in the algorithm choosing a value between `target_time` and `max_time`, but closer
to `target_time`. For example, with the following:

```json
{
    "metrics": {
        "time": {
            "type": "time",
            "target_time": 5,
            "max_time": 10,
            "penalty_at_max": 0.1
        }
    }
}
```

If the algorithm takes 5.0 seconds, no penalty is introduced. At 6.0 seconds, the penalty is:

    = ((6 - 5) ^ 2 / (10 - 5)^2)*0.1
    = 0.0025

At 9 seconds, the penalty is:

    = ((9 - 5) ^ 2 / (10 - 5) ^ 2)*0.1
    = 0.064

At 10 seconds, the penalty is:

    = ((10 - 5) ^ 2 / (10 - 5) ^ 2)*0.1
    = 0.1

Longer times will have even larger penalties.

    - validation of json-schemas
    - Ability to accept yaml as well as JSON
    - Able to have fixed values inside of the hyper-parameter schemas.

    - Hypermax saves results / reloads from where it left off by default
    - Try to lock in package versions related to Hyperopt so people don't have problems on installation
    - Need a better way of handling exceptions that happen in UI code
