def position_switch_disconnectors(mv_grid, mode='load', status='open'):
    """
    Determine position of switch disconnector in MV grid rings

    Determination of the switch disconnector location is motivated by placing
    it to minimized load flows in both parts of the ring (half-rings).
    The switch disconnecter will be installed to a LV station, unless none
    exists in a ring. In this case, a node of arbitrary type is chosen for the
    location of the switch disconnecter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mv_grid : :class:`~.grid.grids.MVGrid`
        MV grid instance
    mode : str
        Define modus switch disconnector positioning: can be performed based of
        'load', 'generation' or both 'loadgen'. Defaults to 'load'
    status : str
        Either 'open' or 'closed'. Define which status is should be set
        initially. Defaults to 'open' (which refers to conditions of normal
        grid operation).

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple of size 2 specifying their pair of nodes between which the
        switch disconnector is located. The first node specifies the node that
        actually includes the switch disconnector.

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses `nx.algorithms.find_cycle()` to identify nodes that are
    part of the MV grid ring(s). Make sure grid topology data that is provided
    has closed rings. Otherwise, no location for a switch disconnector can be
    identified.
