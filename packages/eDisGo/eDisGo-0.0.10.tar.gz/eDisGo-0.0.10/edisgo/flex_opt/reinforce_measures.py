    Notes
    -----
    Reinforce measures:

    1. Disconnect line at 2/3 of the length between station and critical node
    farthest away from the station and install new standard line
    2. Install parallel standard line

    In LV grids only lines outside buildings are reinforced; loads and
    generators in buildings cannot be directly connected to the MV/LV station.

    In MV grids lines can only be disconnected at LVStations because they
    have switch disconnectors needed to operate the lines as half rings (loads
    in MV would be suitable as well because they have a switch bay (Schaltfeld)
    but loads in dingo are only connected to MV busbar). If there is no
    suitable LV station the generator is directly connected to the MV busbar.
    There is no need for a switch disconnector in that case because generators
    don't need to be n-1 safe.

    Reinforce MV or LV grid due to overloading.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    network : :class:`~.grid.network.Network`
    crit_lines : :pandas:`pandas.DataFrame<dataframe>`
        Dataframe containing over-loaded lines, their maximum relative
        over-loading and the corresponding time step.
        Index of the dataframe are the over-loaded lines of type
        :class:`~.grid.components.Line`. Columns are 'max_rel_overload'
        containing the maximum relative over-loading as float and 'time_index'
        containing the corresponding time step the over-loading occured in as
        :pandas:`pandas.Timestamp<timestamp>`.

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary with :class:`~.grid.components.Line` and the number of Lines
    added.
        
    Notes
    -----
    Reinforce measures:

    1. Install parallel line of the same type as the existing line (Only if
       line is a cable, not an overhead line. Otherwise a standard equipment
       cable is installed right away.)
    2. Remove old line and install as many parallel standard lines as
       needed.
