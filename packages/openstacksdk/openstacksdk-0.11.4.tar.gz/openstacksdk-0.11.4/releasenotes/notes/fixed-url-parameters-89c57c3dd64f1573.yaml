    Fixed an issue where some valid query parameters were not listed causing
    errors due to the new behavior of throwing errors when an invalid filter
    condition is specified. Specifically, ``tenant_id`` as a filter for
    Neutron networks and ``ip_version`` for Neutron netork IP availability.
