Managing Clusters
=================

Clusters are first-class citizens in Senlin service design. A cluster is
defined as a collection of homogeneous objects. The "homogeneous" here means
that the objects managed (aka. Nodes) have to be instantiated from the same
"profile type".


List Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To examine the list of receivers:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: list_cluster

When listing clusters, you can specify the sorting option using the ``sort``
parameter and you can do pagination using the ``limit`` and ``marker``
parameters.

Full example: `manage cluster`_


Create Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a cluster, you will provide a dictionary with keys and values
according to the cluster type referenced.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: create_cluster

Optionally, you can specify a ``metadata`` keyword argument that contains some
key-value pairs to be associated with the cluster.

Full example: `manage cluster`_


Get Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~

To get a cluster based on its name or ID:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: get_cluster

Full example: `manage cluster`_


Find Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find a cluster based on its name or ID:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: find_cluster

Full example: `manage cluster`_


Update Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a cluster is created, most of its properties are immutable. Still, you
can update a cluster's ``name`` and/or ``params``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: update_cluster

Full example: `manage cluster`_


Delete Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A cluster can be deleted after creation, When there are nodes in the cluster,
the Senlin engine will launch a process to delete all nodes from the cluster
and destroy them before deleting the cluster object itself.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: delete_cluster


Cluster Add Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add some existing nodes into the specified cluster.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_add_nodes


Cluster Del Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove nodes from specified cluster.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_del_nodes


Cluster Replace Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace some existing nodes in the specified cluster.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_replace_nodes


Cluster Scale Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inflate the size of a cluster.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_scale_out


Cluster Scale In
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shrink the size of a cluster.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_scale_in


Cluster Resize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resize of cluster.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_resize


Cluster Policy Attach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a policy is attached (bound) to a cluster, it will be
enforced when related actions are performed on that cluster,
unless the policy is (temporarily) disabled on the cluster

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_attach_policy


Cluster Policy Detach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a policy is attached to a cluster, it can be detached
from the cluster at user's request.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: cluster_detach_policy


Cluster Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check cluster health status, Cluster members can be check.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: check_cluster


Cluster Recover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restore a specified cluster, members in the cluster will be checked.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/clustering/cluster.py
   :pyobject: recover_cluster
