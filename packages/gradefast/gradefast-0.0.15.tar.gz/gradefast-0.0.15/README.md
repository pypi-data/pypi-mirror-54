# GradeFast-2019

!['Gradefast Logo'](assets/gradefast-logo.png)

Gradefast is a framework whose intention is to make eYRC evaluations faster and bring a standardization across task evaluations. Most important benefit is that the test scripts can then be extended and be reused in other themes having similar tasks. Primary thought behind making GradeFast is to take care of all the boundary tasks that happen in theme evaluations and also make utility scripts that take care of other common tasks so that a lot of time is saved. Some of these tasks are downloading new submissions, iterating over each of the submission folders, easily finding files to test, comments based on criterias, uploading marks and plagiarism checking. The framework is also easy to use causing less to no cognitive load on a theme developer using it.

## Features

1. Submission downloading
2. Plagiarism checking
3. Primarily built for python but can support evaluation of any other tasks
4. Aggregate results
5. Upload marks
6. Add comments

## Also includes

1. Detailed error logging
2. Timing and static code analysis of scripts
3. Resume tasks from where they are stopped
4. Checking test conventions
5. Boilerplate code generation

## Future work

- [ ] Statistics and analysis of results
- [ ] Sandboxed environments
- [ ] Multi-programming
