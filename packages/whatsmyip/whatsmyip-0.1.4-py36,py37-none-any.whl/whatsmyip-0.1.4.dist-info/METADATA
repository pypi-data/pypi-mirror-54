## Installation and usage

As a CLI tool:
```
$ pip3 install whatsmyip
$ myip
240.0.0.0
```

As a library:
```
>>> from whatsmyip.ip import get_ip
>>> from whatsmyip.providers import GoogleDnsProvider  # Or any other provider
>>> get_ip(GoogleDnsProvider)
'240.0.0.0'
```


## Supported providers

* Google DNS
* httpbin.org
* Cloudflare
    - DNS
    - HTTP


## Goal of this project

The goal of this project is not to become the best tool to check your IP address. 
In that case I recommend you to use something more simple like:

`curl https://httpbin.org/ip`

I've developed this project to have something simple to experiment with when explorering new ideas or techniques.
