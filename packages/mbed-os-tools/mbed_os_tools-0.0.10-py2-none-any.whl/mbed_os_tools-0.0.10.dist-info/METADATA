# Mbed OS tools

This repository contains the Python modules needed to work with Mbed OS. Historically, the Mbed OS tools have been delivered in separate packages and repositories. Their APIs have evolved separately over time, each with their own style and syntax. This project unifies these packages into a single intuitive API.

## Packages

Below is a table showing what packages are delivered from this repository:

| PyPI package | Source | Depends on | Stable API |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| `mbed-os-tools` ([Documentation](docs)) | [`src/`](src) | | **No** |
| `mbed-ls` ([Documentation](packages/mbed-ls/README.md)) | [`packages/mbed-ls/`](packages/mbed-ls) | `mbed-os-tools` | **Yes** |
| `mbed-host-tests` ([Documentation](packages/mbed-host-tests/README.md)) | [`packages/mbed-host-tests/`](packages/mbed-host-tests/) | `mbed-os-tools` | **Yes** |
| `mbed-greentea` ([Documentation](packages/mbed-greentea/README.md)) | [`packages/mbed-greentea/`](packages/mbed-greentea/) | `mbed-os-tools` | **Yes** |

As indicated above, **the API `mbed-os-tools` provides is not stable**. For this reason, please continue to use the other packages.
