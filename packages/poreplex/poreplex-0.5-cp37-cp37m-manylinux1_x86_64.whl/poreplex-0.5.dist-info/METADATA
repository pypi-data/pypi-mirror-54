## Installation
*Poreplex* requires Python 3.5+ and [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install.
This *pip* command installs *poreplex* with its essential dependencies. You may use the
following command.

```bash
pip install poreplex
```

To install it together with all optional dependencies (except *albacore*), use this
command:

```bash
pip install 'poreplex[full]'
```

### Additional (Optional) Dependency
As its inputs, *poreplex* requires the FAST5 files that were basecalled using
[ONT *albacore*](https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads) in advance.
Alternatively, *poreplex* can also internally call *albacore* during the
processing without a prior basecalling if the *albacore* package is
available from the environment.

## Quick Start
Produce FASTQ files without 3′ adapter sequences from a bunch of FAST5 files.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter
```

Four direct RNA sequencing libraries can be barcoded, pooled and sequenced 
together. *Porplex* can demultiplex the librariess into separate FASTQ files.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter --barcoding
```

In addition, *poreplex* can create directories containing hard-links to
the original FAST5 files, organized separately by the barcodes.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter --barcoding --fast5
```

In case the FAST5 files are not basecalled yet, just a switch lets
*poreplex* call *albacore* internally. Multicore machines help.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter --barcoding --fast5 --basecall --parallel 40
```

With the `--live` switch, All tasks can be processed as soon as reads
are produced from MinKNOW.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter --barcoding --basecall --parallel 40 --live
```

One may want to output *aligned* reads directly to BAM files instead of
FASTQ outputs. Poreplex streams the processed reads to *minimap2* and update
the BAM outputs real-time. A pre-built index (not a FASTA) generated using
*minimap2* must be provided for this.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter --barcoding --basecall \
  --parallel 40 --live --align GRCz11-transcriptome.mmidx
```

More vibrant feedback is provided if you turn on the dashboard switch.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --trim-adapter --barcoding --basecall \
  --parallel 40 --live --align GRCz11-transcriptome.mmidx --dashboard
```

*Poreplex* detects pseudo-fusion reads which may originate from
insufficiently segmented signals if `--filter-chimera` is given. This
improves the overall accuracy of demultiplexing.

```bash
poreplex -i path/to/fast5 -o path/to/output --filter-chimera
```

## Barcoding direct RNA sequencing libraries
The official kits and protocols do not support barcoding in the direct RNA
sequencing yet. *Poreplex* enables pooling multiple libraries into a single
DRS run.

ONT direct RNA sequencing libraries are prepared by subsequently attaching
two different 3' adapters, [RTA and RMX](https://community.nanoporetech.com/protocols/sequence-specific-direct-rna-sequencing/v/drss_9035_v1_revg_11may2017/overview-of-the-direct-rna),
respectively. Both are double-stranded DNAs with Y-burged ends on the
3'-sides. Barcoded libraries for *poreplex* can be built with modified versions of
RTA adapters. Unlike in the DNA sequencing libraries, *poreplex* demultiplexes
in signal-level to ensure the highest accuracy. The *poreplex* package
comes with pre-trained demultiplexer models for four different DNA barcodes.
Order these sequences as many as you need in the experiment and replace the
original RTA adapters.

```yaml
BC1 Oligo A: 5'-/5Phos/CCTCCCCTAAAAACGAGCCGCATTTGCGTAGTAGGTTC-3'
BC1 Oligo B: 5'-GAGGCGAGCGGTCAATTTTCGCAAATGCGGCTCGTTTTTAGGGGAGGTTTTTTTTTT-3'
```

```yaml
BC2 Oligo A: 5'-/5Phos/CCTCGTCGGTTCTAGGCATCGCGTATGCTAGTAGGTTC-3'
BC2 Oligo B: 5'-GAGGCGAGCGGTCAATTTTGCATACGCGATGCCTAGAACCGACGAGGTTTTTTTTTT-3'
```

```yaml
BC3 Oligo A: 5'-/5Phos/CCTCCCACTTTCACACGCACTAACCAGGTAGTAGGTTC-3'
BC3 Oligo B: 5'-GAGGCGAGCGGTCAATTTTCCTGGTTAGTGCGTGTGAAAGTGGGAGGTTTTTTTTTT-3'
```

```yaml
BC4 Oligo A: 5'-/5Phos/CCTCCTTCAGAAGAGGGTCGCTTCTACCTAGTAGGTTC-3'
BC4 Oligo B: 5'-GAGGCGAGCGGTCAATTTTGGTAGAAGCGACCCTCTTCTGAAGGAGGTTTTTTTTTT-3'
```

## Basecalling with the ONT Albacore
Most studies requiring signal-level analysis need re-basecalling with
the ONT *albacore* to get the event tables in the FAST5 files. *Poreplex*
can internally call the basecaller core routines of *albacore* to yield
the sequences and tables for the downstream analyses. In fact, running
*albacore* via *poreplex* is remarkably faster than running *albacore*
itself in a multi-core machine thanks to more efficient scheduling of
the computational loads.

</p>

## Live basecalling and processing
One can start the *poreplex* pipeline at any time even before the
sequencing begins. With the `--live` switch turned on, it monitors
every update in input directories and picks the newly created
files up for the whole process of the analysis. In the live mode,
the program keeps running unless a user presses Ctrl-C (in the
standard progress view) or Q (in the full-screen dashboard view). The
[*inotify*](https://pypi.org/project/inotify/) module is required to allow
*poreplex* to run in the live mode.

In case the points of sequencing and analysis are different,
a real-time directory synchronization software like [DirSync
Pro](https://www.dirsyncpro.org/) may help. *Poreplex* detects new files
introduced by moving or closing a file after writing. Files that are
made visible by creating hard or symbolic links or changing permissions
may remain undetected.

## Real-time sequence alignments 
*Poreplex* aligns the reads to a reference transcriptome using
*minimap2* and writes the results to BAM files when an index file for
the reference is provided. Some options that affect the performance of
the alignments can be specified when generating the *minimap2* index.

```bash
wget 'ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_28/gencode.v28.transcripts.fa.gz'
minimap2 -H -k 13 -w 10 -d gencode.v28.transcripts.mmidx gencode.v28.transcripts.fa.gz
poreplex -i /path/to/input -o /path/output --basecall --align gencode.v28.transcripts.mmidx
```

By default, switching on the alignments suppresses the FASTQ
outputs. Those can be recovered by adding `--fastq` to the command line.

## Real-time reports
The results from the real-time alignments with the overall progression of
the pipeline can be visualized as a [full-screen dashboard view in a text
terminal](#screenshot). *Poreplex* shows the real-time report when the
command line includes the `--dashboard` switch along with `--align` for
the index of the reference transcriptome. The names of mapped sequences
are shown as the sequence name in the reference *minimap2* index. To
see them as more familiar names, supply a file containing IDs and names
with the `--contig-aliases` switch. It must be a tab-separated
text file with two columns. The first should contain IDs (in the reference index)
and the second should contain names (to show in the screen). The read counts 
window in the middle of the screen represents the summary of reads categorized by
error status or detected barcodes for multiplexed libraries. A user can
choose a group to show in the window with up and down arrow keys. To stop the
process and close the dashboard, press Q key at any time.

## Pseudo-fusion filter
In the Oxford Nanopore strand sequencing, a read is a snippet from a
very long contiguous signal from a channel. In most cases, there is a gap 
between two different molecules. The gap should be long enough for the *MinKNOW*
to cut signals at the end of sequences. However, the gap between strands
is sometimes not enough, so that a small fraction of reads carry two or more molecules.
This phenomenon can be particularly problematic in the pooled libraries with barcodes
and fusion gene studies. In a few runs in our testing, up to 1% of reads could 
be derived from insufficiently segmented signals. The following plot shows a signal 
sequence continued without any gap between the ends of two differently
adapted RNAs which were prepared independently until the second ligation 
step, before which RNAs were pooled (RT before the ligation includes the heat-
inactivation of enzymes).

</p>

*Poreplex* detects potential artifacts by detecting multiple appearances of the
signature of the DNA adapter in a single read when the `--filter-chimera` switch
is turned on. Note that the default parameters for the filtering can be
too sensitive for some experiments.

## Output formats

### FASTQ
Sequences and quality scores are written to [bgzip](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bgzip.html)-compressed
FASTQ files in the `fastq` subdirectory. Each FASTQ file contains the
entire sequences of a group classified by processing status and
detected barcode.

| File name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `fastq/pass.fastq.gz` | All sequences that were basecalled and passed the basic quality filters in *poreplex*. With `--barcoding`, the passed sequences with no identifiable barcode are written to this file. |
| `fastq/BC#.fastq.gz`  | Sequences with identifiable barcode signals. |
| `fastq/fail.fastq.gz` | Too short sequences that could not be calibrated for the signal processing. |
| `fastq/artifact.fastq.gz` | Sequences that were classified as potential artifacts. |

FASTQ outputs are suppressed when BAM outputs are activated with
the `--align` option. Please add `--fastq` to restore the FASTQ outputs.

### FAST5
To reduce the disk I/O, *poreplex* utilizes the links instead of copying
the original FAST5 to append basecalled results to the file. With the
`--fast5` option, *poreplex* creates hard links of the original FAST5
files reorganized in subdirectories representing each processing status
or barcode. Symbolic links are created in case the hard links are not
possible or `--symlink-fast5` is specified.

The basecalled events, which are stored in `Analyses/Basecall_1D_00*`
of the standard FAST5 files, are written to the `events` subdirectory
instead upon request by `--dump-basecalled-events`. The basecall
event tables for all reads are accessible through a single HDF5 file,
`events/inventory.h5`, by the read id. These tables include an
additional `scaled_mean` column, which contains mean current levels
scaled to match the ONT's reference
[pore model](https://github.com/nanoporetech/kmer_models).

### BAM
The alignments to the reference transcriptome go into BAM files
inside the `bam` subdirectory. The reference sequences must be
indexed using *minimap2* before providing it with the `--align`
option ([see above](#real-time-sequence-alignments)). The BAM
files are not sorted and not filtered thoroughly. FASTQ or FASTA
sequence files can be generated from the BAM files without loss
using [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/bamtofastq.html).
Please use these sequence alignments in the BAM files for quality
checks and sketchy analyses only.

### Nanopolish database
[Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) provides very convenient
tools that help signal-level analyses. *Poreplex* provides a set of index
files that are required to run the *nanopolish* commands. Add `--nanopolish`
to a *poreplex* command line, then just skip `nanopolish extract` or
`nanopolish index` commands in its tutorial, and proceed directly to
the main steps.
