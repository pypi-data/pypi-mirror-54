Description: # Network Stability
        Python module for network connectivity and speed test.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        ```
        Python 3.6+
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        Use the package manager pip to install foobar.
        ```bash
        pip install network_stability
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import network_stability
        
        net = network_stability.NetworkTest()
        # Run connectivity test.
        net.connection_test_interval(hours=0.5)
        net.export_connection_results('connection.csv')
        net.report_connection('connection.png')
        # Run speed test.
        net.speed_test_interval(minutes=30)
        net.export_speed_results('speed.csv')
        net.report_speed('speed.png')
        ```

        * This project inspiration came after struggles to watch The Office in my TV. I had  a  wifi  extender that I was 
        distrusting. I needed some tests to check if it was messing with my network stability.
