  """Enumerates arrays in a Table.

  It assumes all the columns in `table` has only one chunk.
  It assumes `table` contains only arrays of the following supported types:
    - list<primitive>
    - list<struct<[Ts]>> where Ts are the types of the fields in the struct
      type, and they can only be one of the supported types
      (recursion intended).

  It enumerates each column (i.e. array, because there is only one chunk) in
  the table (also see `enumerate_leaves_only`) If an array is of type
  list<struct<[Ts]>>, then it flattens the outermost list, then enumerates the
  array of each field in the result struct<[Ts]> array, and continues
  recursively. The weights get "aligned" automatically in this process,
  therefore weights, the third term in the returned tuple always has array[i]'s
  weight being weights[i].

  Args:
    table: The Table whose arrays to be visited. It is assumed that the table
      contains only one chunk.
    weight_column: The name of the weight column, or None. The elements of
      the weight column should be lists of numerics, and each list should
      contain only one value.
    enumerate_leaves_only: If True, only enumerate "leaf" arrays.
      Otherwise, also enumerate the struct arrays where the leaf arrays are
      contained.

  Yields:
    A tuple. The first term is the path of the feature; the second term is
    the feature array and the third term is the weight array for the feature
    array (i.e. weights[i] is the weight for array[i]).

  Raises:
    ValueError: When the weight column is not a list array whose elements are
      not 1-element lists.
