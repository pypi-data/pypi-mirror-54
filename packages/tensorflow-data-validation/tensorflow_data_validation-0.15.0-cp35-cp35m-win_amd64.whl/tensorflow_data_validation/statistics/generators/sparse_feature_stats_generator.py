"""Module that computes statistics used to validate sparse features.

Currently, this module generates the following statistics for each
sparse feature:
- missing_value: Number of examples missing the value_feature.
- missing_index: A RankHistogram from index_name to the number of examples
                 missing the corresponding index_feature.
- min_length_diff: A RankHistogram from index_name to the minimum of
                   len(index_feature) - len(value_feature).
- max_length_diff: A RankHistogram from index_name to the maximum of
                   len(index_feature) - len(value_feature).
