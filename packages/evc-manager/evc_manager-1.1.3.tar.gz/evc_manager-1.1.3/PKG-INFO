Description: # AmLight Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) Manager
        
        The AmLight EVC Manager is a tool to help SDN operators to manage
        multiple Ethernet Virtual Circuits in a batch operation, such as
        creating/deleting/changing multiple EVCs at a time. It was created to
        help AmLight network engineers in the daily operation of the AmLight SDN
        network, which currently has more than one thousands flows and more than
        ten OpenFlow switches in North and South America.
        
        The AmLight EVC\_Manager requires Python 3.6.
        
        # Features
        
        The EVC Manager was created with the following major goals:
        
        >   - Support multiple backends, such as OESS and Kytos E-Line.
        >   - Support exporting all circuits to YAML or JSON files
        >   - Support creating/changing/deleting multiple circuits via YAML
        >     files
        >   - Support moving circuits out a specific link (or NNI)
        >   - Support forcing circuit reprovisioning
        >   - Support changing circuits' paths
        >   - Support exporting monitoring data using Zabbix LLD format for
        >     integration with Zabbix
        >   - Support multiple queries:
        >       - Get VLANs in use in a specific UNI or NNI
        >       - Get circuits using a specific UNI or NNI
        >       - Get circuit utilization
        >       - Get circuit with under-provisioned paths
        >       - Get circuits using backup paths
        >       - Get list of devices and links
        >       - Compare and report two EVC dumps

              is_backup: is it using a backup path?
              is_optimized: is it using under-provisioned links? (not enough BW, delay higher that required, etc.)
