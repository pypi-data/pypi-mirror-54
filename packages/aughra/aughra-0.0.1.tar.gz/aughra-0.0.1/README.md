*Aughra* is a planned root directory for the [Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid.html) framework.
Aughra is intended to deploy information about public [Vivid Stores](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/store.html)

Aughra is open source, based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
programming language and actively developed as part of the
[Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/vivid) framework at
[Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org).
