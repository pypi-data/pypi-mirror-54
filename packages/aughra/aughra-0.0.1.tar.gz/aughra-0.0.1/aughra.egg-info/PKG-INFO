        *Aughra* is a planned root directory for the [Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid.html) framework.
        Aughra is intended to deploy information about public [Vivid Stores](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/store.html)
        to allow an automatic configuration of [Vivid Nodes](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/node.html).
        
        Aughra is open source, based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
        programming language and actively developed as part of the
        [Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/vivid) framework at
        [Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org).
