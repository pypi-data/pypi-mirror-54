Description: SuMPF
        =====
        
        The *SuMPF* package provides some classes, that implement offline (non-realtime) signal processing functionalities.
        *SuMPF* is being developed with a focus on acoustics, but it might be applicable for the analysis of other time series data as well.
        
        Here is a brief example of *SuMPF* in action:
        
        >>> import sumpf
        >>> noise = sumpf.GaussianNoise(mean=0.0,
        ...                             standard_deviation=1.0,
        ...                             sampling_rate=48000.0,
        ...                             length=2 ** 14)
        >>> filter_ = sumpf.ButterworthFilter(cutoff_frequency=1000.0, order=4, highpass=True)
        >>> filtered = noise * filter_
        >>> spectrum = filtered.fourier_transform()
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The *SuMPF* package requires Python version 3.7 or later.
        Most features should be available with Python 3.6 as well.
        
        ::
        
           pip3 install sumpf
