Description: # bfit
        Beta-NMR GUI for reading, drawing, fitting data. 
        
        ## Run Instructions
        
        To run, call `python3 -m bfit`
        
        ## Setup after Install
        
        Install is done simply by `pip install bfit`. Afterwards, you may want to tell bfit where the data is stored. This is done by defining environment variables
        `BNMR_ARCHIVE` and `BNQR_ARCHIVE` (for convenience add this to your .bashrc script). The expected file format is as follows: 
        
            /path/
                bnmr/
                bnqr/
                    2017/
                    2018/
                        045123.msr
        
        In this example, you would set `BNQR_ARCHIVE=/path/bnqr/` to the directory containing the year directories.
        
        If bfit cannot find the data, it will attempt to download the files from [musr.ca](http://musr.ca/mud/runSel.html) according to the defaults set in the [bdata](https://pypi.org/project/bdata/) package. 
        
        ## Operation Details
        
        See [here](https://github.com/dfujim/bfit/blob/master/bfit/fitting/README.md) for the bfit fitting submodule documentation.
