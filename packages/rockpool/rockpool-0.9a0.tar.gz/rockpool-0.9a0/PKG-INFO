        Installation instructions
        =========================
        
        Clone the repository.
        
        `$ git checkout <git url>`
        `$ cd network-architectures`
        
        Use `pip` to install Rockpool and required dependencies
        
        `$ pip install -e . --user`
        
        The `--user` option installs an egg only for the current user.
        The -e option allows you to install this as a development version so you can make changes.
        
        If you want to install all the extra dependencies required for Brian, PyTorch and Jax layers, use the command
        
        `$ pip install -e .[all] --user`
