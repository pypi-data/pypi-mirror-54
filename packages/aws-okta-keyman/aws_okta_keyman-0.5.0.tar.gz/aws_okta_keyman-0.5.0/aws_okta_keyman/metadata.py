AWS Okta Keyman
===============
AWS Okta Keyman is a command-line interface for retrieving temporary
credentials from AWS for use during development. It authenticates with Okta
and then retrieves keys from AWS. These are saved in ~/aws/credentials for
use with other software. AWS Okta Keyman supports multiple MFA solutions.

It's based on `nd_okta_auth <http://github.com/Nextdoor/nd_okta_auth>`_
by `Nextdoor.com, Inc <https://github.com/Nextdoor>`_.
