Pyunraid is a Python library designed to interface directly with an Unraid server
without installing any software on directly on the server.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyunraid.

```bash
pip install pyunraid
```

## Usage

```python
from pyunraid.unraid import Unraid

# Create Unraid server object
unraid = Unraid('192.168.1.4', 'root', 'your-secure-password')

# Get all Docker containers
containers = unraid.containers()
```
