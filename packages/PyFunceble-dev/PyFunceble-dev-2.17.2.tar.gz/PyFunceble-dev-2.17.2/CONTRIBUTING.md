I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need contributions to make this tool one of the best tool around the Internet!

# Submitting changes

Before anything, please keep in mind the following. If one or more of those conditions are not filled. Your Pull Request to PyFunceble may not be merged.

The `master` branch is used only for releasing a new **stable** version of the code. That's why we require that all contributions/modifications must be done under the `dev` or a new branch.

In order to gain sometime and also understand what you are working on, your pull requests submission as long as your commit descriptions should be clear and complete as much as possible. We do an exception for commit with minor changed but big changes should have a complete description. Please ensure to use the following method before commiting.

# Steps before commits

_Note: The following do not apply if you do not touch the `PyFunceble` nor the `tests` directory._

```shell
$ # We format our code.
$ black PyFunceble && black tests/*.py
$ # We lint our code. Please make sure to fix all reported issues.
$ pylint PyFunceble && pylint tests/*.py
$ # We check the tests coverage. Please ensure that at lease 95% of the code is covered.
$ coverage run setup.py test && coverage report -m
$ # Prepare our files, `version.yaml` and code for pushing.
$ PyFunceble --production
```

# The commit

```shell
$ # The paragraph is optional if your changes/commits are obvious.
$ git commit -S -m "A summary of the commit" -m "A paragraph
> or a sentence explaining what changed, why and its impact."
```

All your commits should be signed with **PGP** _(Please read more [here](https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification))_.

Please note the usage of `-S` into the commit command which means that we sign the commit.

The usage of `PyFunceble --production` update `version.yaml` and `directory_structure_production.json` automatically according to you current branch or output directory structure.
