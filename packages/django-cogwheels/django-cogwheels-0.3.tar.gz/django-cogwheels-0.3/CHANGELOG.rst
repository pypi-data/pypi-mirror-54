Changelog
=========

0.3 (XX.XX.XXXX) (IN DEVELOPMENT)
---------------------------------

- Add support for Django 2.2
- Add support for Python 3.8
- Added the ``warn_only_if_overridden`` argument to all 'value fetching' methods on ``BaseAppSettingsHelper``, which can be used to request deprecated setting values without raising the usual 'this setting is deprecated' warning, but will raise a warning if the setting is overridden.
- Improved the consistency of error messages raised when attribute helpers or methods are called with invalid setting names, by introducing a new ``UnknownSettingNameError`` exception class and more helpful messaging.
- Renamed ``BaseAppSettingsHelper.raise_setting_error()`` to ``_raise_setting_value_error()`` (making it a private method).


0.2 (02.08.2018)
----------------

- Added official support for Python 3.7.
- Default deprecation warning messages have been updated to include an indication of when a deprecated setting will be removed, and better explain the consequences of not updating.
- Default deprecation warning messages no longer include text to indicate that developers should "review the release notes and/or documentation". In cases where further information is required, it should be provided as ``additional_guidance``, which may also include a hyperlink to the relevant release notes / documentation where considered useful.
- ``DeprecatedAppSetting`` now supports an ``additional_guidance`` argument at initialisation, that can be used to add further context-specific information for each deprecation as required, which will be appended to the default warning text.
- Added the ``suppress_warnings`` argument to all 'value fetching' methods on ``BaseAppSettingsHelper``, to allow suppressing of any deprecation warnings when fetching a specific setting value.
- Added the ``warning_stacklevel`` argument to all 'value fetching' methods on ``BaseAppSettingsHelper``, which is passed to ``warnings.warn()`` as ``stacklevel`` when raising any deprecation warnings related to the setting. The default value used for each method results in the user's initial method call being identified as the cause of the warning when it is eventually raised by ``DeprecatedAppSetting``'s ``warn_if_setting_attribute_referenced()`` and ``warn_if_user_using_old_setting_name()`` methods.
- Added the ``is_value_from_deprecated_setting()`` method to ``BaseAppSettingsHelper`` to help developers determine where a setting value came from when dealing settings that replace deprecated settings.
- Added support for deprecation scenarios where a new setting might replace multiple other settings.
- Renamed the ``get_raw()`` method on ``BaseAppSettingsHelper`` to ``get()`` .
