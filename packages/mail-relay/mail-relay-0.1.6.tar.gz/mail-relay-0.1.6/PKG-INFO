        ## Install
        
        Currently py27 is the only supported python version. It is recommended that you install this tool within a fresh virtual environment. More info on https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/.
        
        ```shell
        > cd ${repo_root}
        > ${envpip} install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_${osx/linux}.txt
        > ${envpip} install .
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Testing
        
        We use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the project's test runner. Make sure you have **tox >= 3.5.3** installed in your python environment.
        
        #### Run all tests
        
        ```shell
        > cd ${repo_core}
        > tox
        ```
        
        
        
        #### Unit tests
        
        ```shell
        > tox -e unit-${darwin/linux}
        ```
        
        
        
        #### Integration tests
        
        ```shell
        > tox -e integration-${darwin/linux}
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Linting
        
        We use [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) as project's linter. Enforcement via:
        
        ```shell
        > tox -e flake8
        ```
        
        
        ## Some helper CLIs through make
        There are some handy make commands that you can use. Check out usage:
        
        ```shell
        > cd ${repo-root}
        > make
        ```
