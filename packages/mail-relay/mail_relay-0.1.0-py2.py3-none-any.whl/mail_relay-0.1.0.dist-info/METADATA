Mail Relay is a python tool that
*   uses **Export Group** of an organization to **decrypt** PreVeil encrypted emails
*   and **relays** them to a configurable IMAP or SMTP destination.


## Install

```shell
> cd ${repo_root}
> ${envpip} install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_${osx/linux}.txt

## Usage

Mail relay exposes a command line interface relay, with which you can configure and initialize the relay process.

```shell

> relay --help # inspect full list of options/commands/arguments
```
