Description: 
        Sends event if the yarn-cluster is empty/free to trigger other stuff (e.g. send you an email or start another application)
        
        The HadoopYarnClusterChecker-Class checks your cluster if there is any application run on it. In case your cluster is free it fires an event.
        
        # how it works:
        * it's false positive: if there is any error like it can not connect to your yarn-rest-api it sends the event.
        * algorithm:
          * receive data from: "/ws/v1/cluster/apps"-REST endpoint
          * are there applications with the state "running"?
            * Yes: Is this application excluded?
            * Yes: Are there more running applications?
              * No: send the event
              * Yes: sleep for the intervall & start with the first bulletin-point
        # Excludes
        * has to be a String
        * excludes for state-attribute are forbidden!
        * don't forget to escape the \"
        * JSON-Notation:
          * Array
          * Key-Value-Object
          * Key: XML-Tag from the Yarn-Api
          * example: 
          ```json
          "[
          {\"name\":\"Zeppelin\"},
          {\"name\":\"Zeppelin1\"}
          ]"
          ```
            * meaning: all Applications with the Name "Zeppelin" and "Zeppelin1" will be excluded in case they're running
            * filtering:
              * for state-attribute is forbidden!
              * for multiple attributes like an AND should work:
                ```json
                [
                 {
                  "name":"Zeppelin", 
                  "priority":0
                  }
                ]
                ```
        
        # How to use it:
        
        ```python
        import hadoop-yarn-cluster-checker-lib
        
        checker = HadoopYarnClusterChecker(server=args.server, path=args.path, intervall=args.intervall, log=args.log,
                                                                       excludes=args.excludes)
        checker.on_empty_cluster += event_empty
        ```
