  Typical DIALS output for a small-molecule dataset.

  These were derived from the DIALS small molecule tutorial L-cysteine dataset
  (https://zenodo.org/record/51405 files l-cyst_0[1-4].tar.gz).

  On a linux terminal, the relevant CBF-format image files can be obtained with
  $ curl -O https://zenodo.org/record/51405/files/l-cyst_0[1-4].tar.gz
  $ ls *tar.gz | xargs -i tar xzf {}

  The datablock.json file was then generated using
  $ dials.import allow_multiple_sweeps=True l-cyst_0*cbf

  and the strong.pickle file was generated using
  $ dials.find_spots datablock.json

data:
