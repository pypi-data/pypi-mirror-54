pip3 install explore
```

## Specific Usage

```python
import explore

# yummy foods to choose from
foods = ('pasta', 'pork', 'broccoli', 'anchovy', 'peking duck')

# choosing during a keyboard stroke
food = explore.pick(foods, 'vorcloki')
```

## Generic Usage
```python
import explore

# lots of yummy food info
foods = food_api.get_all()

# match according to these attributes
fetch = lambda food: (food.id, food.name)

# returns value, NOT attribute matched against
food = explore.pick(foods, 'vorcloki', fetch = fetch)
```

## Extended Usage
```python
import explore

# lots of yummy food info
foods = food_api.get_all()

# match according to these attributes
fetch = lambda food: (food.id, food.name, food.color)

# this is a generator, iterating exhausts it
pairs = explore.generic(fetch, values, 'vorcloki') # [(food, score), ...]

# best matching one
food = explore.lead(pairs)
