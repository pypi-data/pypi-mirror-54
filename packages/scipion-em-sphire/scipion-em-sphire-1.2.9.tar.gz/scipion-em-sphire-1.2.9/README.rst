Sphire Scipion plugin
=====================

This plugin allows to use cryolo within Scipion framework.
So far we have implemented:

- crYOLO particle picker (current version: 1.5.3)

This plugin will be able to install cryolo 1.5.3 and the generic model.



`crYOLO`_ is a pipeline for particle detection in cryo-electron
microscopy images which is based on the deep learning object detection system "You Only Look Once" (YOLO).


Setup
=====

Requires to have conda installed and not initialized in the shell.

For Users
---------

Install `Scipion2`_, follow the 'crYOLO integration' instructions below and `install`_ the cryolo plugin.

For developers
--------------

1. For testing and develop this plugin, you need to use the Scipion v2.0 in devel. 
   For that, just install Scipion from `GitHub`_, using the ‘devel’ branch. 
2. Follow the 'crYOLO integration' instructions below.
3. Clone this repository in you system: 
   ::

      cd
      git clone https://github.com/scipion-em/scipion-em-sphire
   
4. Install the sphire plugin in devel mode:
   ::
      
      scipion installp -p ~/scipion-em-sphire --devel


crYOLO integration
------------------

The following steps presuppose that you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on
your computer.
In ``~/.config/scipion/scipion.conf`` set **CONDA_ACTIVATION_CMD** variable in
the Packages section.

For example:

::

 CONDA_ACTIVATION_CMD = . ~/anaconda2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

Notice the command starts with a period! This will source the conda.sh script.
This is needed to activate the conda environment.
For further information please visit the following website
`[here] <https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#440-2017-12-20>`_

If you wish to install the plugin with the default settings just go to plugin
manager and install scipion-em-sphire. This will create the default environment
named cryolo and download version 1.4.0 for you.

You are ready to use crYOLO.
If you wish to change the environment name you can introduce
**CRYOLO_ENV_ACTIVATION** variable in the ``~/.config/scipion.conf`` variables section:

For example:
::

 CRYOLO_ENV_ACTIVATION = conda activate yourdesiredname

crYOLO general model is not installed by default. You may install it by
expanding the plugin in the plugin manager and install it.
This will install the general model to a default location: ``~/scipion/software/em/cryolo_model-20190516``.

If you wish to provide a different general model:
Set **CRYOLO_GENERIC_MODEL** variable in the ``~/.config/scipion.conf`` variables section:

For example:

::

 CRYOLO_GENERIC_MODEL = /your/desired/location/myownmodelname.h5


Running crYOLO tests
----------------------
To check that everything is properly installed and configured, you might want
to run some tests:

.. code-block::

   scipion test --grep cryolo --run
