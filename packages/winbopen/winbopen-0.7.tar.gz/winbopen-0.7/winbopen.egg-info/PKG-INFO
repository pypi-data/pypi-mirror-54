Description: Opens ipynb files on double-click
        
        winbopen looks for the nearest running notebook server - if it finds one, it
        opens a web browser to that notebook. If not, it starts a new notebook server
        in that directory.
        
        
        Installation::
        
            pip install winbopen
        
        Usage::
        
            double-click on ipynb
        
        If double-clicking does not work or you're not on Windows, run:
        
        * Linux/BSD: ``python3 -m nbopen.install_xdg``
        * Windows: normally automatic; for manual installation run ``python3 -m nbopen.install_win``
        * Mac: Clone the repository and run ``./osx-install.sh``
        
        This is a fork of Thomas Kluyver's [nbopen](https://github.com/takluyver/nbopen) focused on Windows platform
        with the following improvements:
          
        * automatic installation with only one call to `pip install`
        * original nbopen stops working at a certain point of time - this bug is fixed
