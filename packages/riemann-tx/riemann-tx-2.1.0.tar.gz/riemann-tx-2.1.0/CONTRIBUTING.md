Hi! Thanks for contributing to Riemann!

We have a few rules for contributors. These rules are designed to protect
contributors and users

1. Be cool
2. Sign your commits
3. Run the tests
4. Riemann is free software

### Be cool

Riemann is a community project. Be a cool community.

### Sign your commits

Riemann is critical infrastructure. We require signed commits.

If you're not already set up to sign commits, follow these steps:

1. [Make a new GPG key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/)
2. [Add the public key to your github account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/)
3. [Set git to sign your commits](https://help.github.com/articles/telling-git-about-your-gpg-key/)

If you've already made unsigned commits, that's no biggie. Set up signing and
then squash your branch. We can help you out if necessary.

### Run the tests

PRs will not be merged if they decrease test coverage. You can run the tests
with `pytest`. For coverage details, run `tox`.

### Riemann is free software

This code is all released under the LGPL. There's no CLA carve-out for the
company. When you contribute to Riemann, your code will be released under the
LGPL license.

### Contributing to docs

Docstrings are mandatory going forward. You can find the RST source in
`docs/source`. :)
