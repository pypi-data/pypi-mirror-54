`adcc` (**ADC-connect**) is a `python`-based framework to connect to arbitrary programs
for running calculations based on the algebraic-diagrammatic construction
approach (ADC) on top of their self-consistent field (SCF) reference.
For more details and installation instructions
[see the `adcc` documentation](https://adc-connect.org).
