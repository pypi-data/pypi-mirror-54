Description: adcc is a python-based framework for performing quantum-chemical simulations
        based upon the algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) approach.
        
        As of now PP-ADC and CVS-PP-ADC methods are available to compute excited
        states on top of an MP2 ground state. The underlying Hartree-Fock reference
        is not computed inside adcc, much rather external packages should be used
        for this purpose. Interfaces to seamlessly interact with pyscf, psi4,
        VeloxChem or molsturm are available, but other SCF codes or even statically
        computed data can be easily used as well.
