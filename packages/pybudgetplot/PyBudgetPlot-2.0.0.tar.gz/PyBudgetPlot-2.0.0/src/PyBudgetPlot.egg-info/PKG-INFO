        ============
        
        
            Simple budged plotting application.
        
        
        Description
        ===========
        
            Takes a budget definition from .yaml file and plots the near future.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First check your version of pip by calling `pip --version`
        
            - If the output says (Python 3.*) -> install with `pip install PyBudgetPlot`
        
            - If not -> install with `pip3 install PyBudgetPlot`
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        1. Open terminal/CMD and navigate to preferred working dir
        
        2. Init sample budget.yaml in the current working dir
        
            - type `init-budget` and hit ENTER
        
        3. Open the 'budget.yaml' with a text redactor and use it as a base for creating you budget definition.
        
            - the 'Dates' section is used to define the scale of the plot, but it's not mandatory.
        
            - if you delete the 'Dates' section, the program will default to [start=today, end=after 365 days]
        
        4. Save your changes and plot your budget
        
            - type `plot-budget` and hit ENTER
        
        5. Interactive UI panel will appear showing the budget plot
        
            - use it to inspect/export your plot or parts of it
