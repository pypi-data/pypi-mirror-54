        ----------
        delta_value : int or float
            The difference in quality between the current state and the
            potential new state. This can be calculated by substracting the
            quality of the current state from the quality of the potential new

        -------
        bool
            The function returns true if the problem is accepted,
            the function returns false if the problem is rejected.
