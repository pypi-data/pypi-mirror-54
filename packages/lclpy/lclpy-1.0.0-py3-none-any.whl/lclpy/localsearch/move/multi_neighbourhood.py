class MultiNeighbourhood(AbstractMove):
    """Implements a class that can be used to combine different move functions.

    Moves are represented in the following way: \n
    (index move function, a representation of a move from said move function)\n
    Note that all move functions must work on the same type of data structure.
    Combining move functions meant for different data structures won't work.

    Parameters
    ----------
    move_func_list : list of AbstractMove or tuple of AbstractMove
        A list or tuple that contains the move functions one wishes to combine.
    weights : list of int or tuple of int, optional
        A list or tuple that contains weights to increase or decrease the
        chance of a move function being used to generate a random move. The
        weight for a function must have the same index as the function.
        Weights are positive numbers and need to be defined for every move
        function. In the default case, every function will have the same
        weight. Note that it's perfectly possible to pass the probabilities
        instead of the weights.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _move_func_list : tuple of AbstractMove
        Contains all used move functions.
    _size : int
        The size of _move_func_list.
    _tresholds : tuple of float
        Tresholds associated with the move functions.

    Examples
    --------
    Get all possible moves, you should NEVER do this. You should evaluate only
    one move at a time. This example is simply to show the behaviour of
    get_moves and how to perform and undo a move:
