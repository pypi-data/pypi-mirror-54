class MaxSecondsTerminationCriterion(AbstractTerminationCriterion):
    """Termination criterion to terminate after a set amount of seconds.

    Note that this terminationcriterion isn't exact. It will only terminate
    the algorithm after iterating longer than the set time AND if an iteration
    is finished. The extra time that the algorithm will run depends on the
    duration of the last iteration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_seconds : int or float, optional
        The maximal amount of seconds passed. The default is 60 seconds.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _max_seconds : int or float
        The maximal amount of seconds passed.
    _seconds : float
        The amount of seconds passed since the start of the iterations
    _start : float
        The moment when the time starts to be measured in seconds measured
        from the epoch.

    Examples
    --------
    Running for 60 seconds (default):
