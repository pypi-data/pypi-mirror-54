After building the DataFed project, the Python CLI module must be packaged and deployed to PyPi or TestPyPi.

To package, run the following command from the ...DataFed/build/python/datafed_pkg directory:

    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

To deploy to TestPyPi, run:

    python3 -m twine upload --skip-existing --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

* PyPi and TestPyPi do not allow a deployed version to overwritten. You must increment the version number each time.
* The --skip-existing option is only needed if multiple versions have been built locally.
* You may need to temporarily alter the package name in the setup.py file to avoid conflicts with other developers.

To deploy to PyPi, run:

    TBD

twine upload -r pypi home/cades/jbreet/DataFed/build/python/datafed_pkg/dist/datafed-0.6.0.tar.gz
