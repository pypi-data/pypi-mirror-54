        ## What is it?
        sphinx_pyviz_theme is the theme that is used when building sites in the
        [pyviz](https://pyviz.org) ecosystem. This theme is best used in conjunction
        with [nbsite](https://github/pyviz/nbsite). See the [nbsite docs](https://nbsite.pyviz.org)
        for examples.
        
        ## How to use
        
        To use this theme: `pip/conda install sphinx_pyviz_theme` and set html_theme to sphinx_pyviz_theme. To control the look and feel, change html_theme_options in conf.py:
        
        ```python
        html_static_path += ['_static']
        html_theme = 'sphinx_pyviz_theme'
        html_theme_options = {
            'custom_css': 'site.css',
            'logo': 'nbsite-logo.png',
            'favicon': 'favicon.ico',
            'primary_color': '#F16A25',
            'primary_color_dark': '#B5501C',
            'secondary_color': '#F5C33C',
            'second_nav': False,
        }
        ```
        
         - logo and favicon: provide paths relative to html_static_path (doc/_static by default)
         - primary_color, primary_color_dark and secondary_color: control the colors that the
           website uses for header, nav, links... These can be css named colors, or hex colors.
         - second_nav: Boolean indicating whether to use a second nav bar.
         - custom_css: path relative to html_static_path overriding styles.
           Styles come first from the theme's main.css_t, which is populated with the
           colors options, then extended/overridden by your site's own css.
        
        **NOTE:** Only use the custom_css to overwrite small pieces of the css not to make
        general improvements. If you have general improvements, please open a PR on the this repo.
