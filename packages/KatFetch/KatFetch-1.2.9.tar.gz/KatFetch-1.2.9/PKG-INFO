Description: # KatFetch
        
        KatFetch is a minimal and customizable fetch script.
        
        ## What is a fetch script?
        
        A fetch script is a script that **fetches** some information about your system. It is commonly used when taking screenshots of your desktop and is designed to show off your terminal and it's colours.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install KatFetch using Pip. Simply run ```pip3 install katfetch``` as root (or use the --user option if ~/.local/bin is in your path).
        
        KatFetch also includes an installer. To use it, simply run `python3 setup.py install` and KatFetch will be installed to `/usr/bin` along with all dependencies.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        Note: If you install KatFetch using `setup.py`, all dependencies are installed automatically. To remove unwanted dependencies, you can simply remove them from the `install_requires` list.
        
        To display all information entries, KatFetch requires some dependencies, however all of these are optional (with the exception of Click). If you don't want to install a specific module, simply remove
        the offending entry from `get_info()` and the `entries` array in `main()`.
        
        |      Module      |                        Used for                       |
        |:----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|
        |     `distro`     |               Getting Linux Distribution              |
        |     `cpuinfo`    |                Getting CPU information                |
        | `hurry.filesize` |     Displaying RAM usage as a human readable value    |
        |     `psutil`     |                   Getting RAM usage                   |
        |     `click`      |Displaying entries in colour, colour bar and arguments |
        
        ## Command line arguments
        
        -  --color TEXT      Accent color.
        -  --nobar           Don't show bar.
        -  --barlen INTEGER  Number of colour blocks to display.
        -  --showbg          Show background colour block in colour bar.
        -  --block TEXT      Block character to use in bar.
        -  --height INTEGER  Height of bar.
        -  --fg              Colour the foreground of the block character.
        -  --nocol           Disable accent colours.
        -  --stdout          Combine --nobar and --nocol to output text with no fancy
                             formatting.
        -  --help            Show help message and exit.
        
        ## Adding and removing entries
        
        Adding an extra line of information is super simple. Each entry is stored in a list. First, you need to add some code that will get you the information you want to add as a function. Then, add some code similar to this to the `display_entries()` function.
        
        ```python
        display_entry("Greeting", "Hello, World!", color)
        ```
        This will output something like:
        
        **Greeting** Hello, World!
        
        Where "Greeting" uses the colour you specified (if `color` is set to `None`, no colour will be displayed).
        
        Removing entries is very similar and even easier, simply remove them from the `display_entries()` function.
        
        ## Improving speed
        
        Out of the box, KatFetch can be a little slow to run. On my system, it can take up to 1 second for KatFetch to finish displaying info. This is caused by the function that gets processor information and is out of my control.
        
        If you don't really need to see processor information, you can simply remove it from `get_info()` and the `entries` list (see adding and removing entries above) for a massive speed boost.
        
        ## Running on Windows
        
        KatFetch will not run on Windows. I currently have no intentions to support Windows, however, if you would like to, you can make a fork and add the necessary code.
        
        ## Things planned for the future
        
        There are a couple more things I need to implement. Pull requests for these features would be super helpful.
        
        - Find a way to get pretty terminal application instead of TERM variable.
