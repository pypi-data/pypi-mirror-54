Description: NLDSL is a tool to create domain specific languages (DSLs) for data science,which can be translated into executable code. A new DSL is created by deriving fromthe CodeGenerator class and rules are added to it via simple python functions.Besides providing code generation NLDSL allows the user to define DSL-level function,which are then treated as first-class rules.Currently we provide extensions for Pandas and PySpark.
