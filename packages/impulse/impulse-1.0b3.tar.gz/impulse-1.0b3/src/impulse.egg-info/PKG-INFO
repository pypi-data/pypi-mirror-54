        Impulse is a command line tool for exploring the imports in a Python package.
        
        It can be used to produce dependency graphs such as this:

        **Warning:** This software is currently in beta. It is undergoing active development, and breaking changes may be
        introduced between versions.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install Graphviz
        ****************
        
        First, you will need to install Graphviz. For more information, see the
        `Graphviz download page`_ or search for "how to install Graphviz" on your operating system.
        
        
        .. _Graphviz download page: https://www.graphviz.org/download/
        
        Install Impulse
        ***************
        
        ::
        
            pip install impulse
        
        Install the Python package you wish to analyse
        **********************************************
        
        ::
        
            pip install somepackage
        
        Command overview
        ----------------
        
        There is currently only one command, feel free to suggest more by opening an issue or pull request.
        
        ``drawgraph``
        *************
        
        Draw a graph of the dependencies within any installed Python package or subpackage.
        
        The graph shows the relationship between all the immediate children of the package. An arrow indicates that there is
        at least one import by the child (or any of its descendants) from the subpackage where the arrow points.
        
        For example, in a graph of the package ``django.db``, there is an arrow from ``django.db.backends`` pointing to
        ``django.db.models``.  This is because ``django.db.backends.base.schema`` imports ``django.db.models.Index``. All
        descendants are treated as belonging to the child they are in, so an import between any of those descendants will
        cause an import to be shown.
        
        **Command**::
        
            impulse drawgraph django.db
        
        **Output:**
