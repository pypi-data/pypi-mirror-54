pyungo
======

pyungo is a lightweight library to link a set of dependent
functions together, and execute them in an ordered manner.

pyungo is built around ``Graphs`` and ``Nodes`` used in a
`DAG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_
(Directed Acyclic Graph). A `Node` represent a function being
run with a defined set of inputs and returning one or several
outputs. A ``Graph`` is a collection of ``Nodes`` where data
can flow in an logical manner, the output of one node serving
as input of another.

installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    >> pip install pyungo

simple example
--------------

.. code-block:: python

    graph = Graph()

    @graph.register(inputs=['d', 'a'], outputs=['e'])
    def f_my_function_2(d, a):
        return d - a

    @graph.register(inputs=['c'], outputs=['d'])
    def f_my_function_1(c):
        return c / 10.

    @graph.register(inputs=['a', 'b'], outputs=['c'])
    def f_my_function_3(a, b):
        return a + b

    res = graph.calculate(data={'a': 2, 'b': 3})
    print(res)

pyungo is registering the functions at import time. It then
resolve the ``DAG`` and figure out the sequence at which the
functions have to be run per their inputs / outputs. In this 
case, it will be function 3 then 1 and finally 2.

The ordered ``Graph`` is run with ``calculate``, with the given
data. It returns the output of the last function being 
run (e), but all intermediate results are also available 
in the ``graph`` instance.

The result will be (a + b) / 10 - a = -1.5
