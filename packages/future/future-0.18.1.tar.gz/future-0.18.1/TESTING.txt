Currently the tests are passing on OS X and Linux on Python 2.7 and 3.4.

The test suite can be run with:

    $ tox

which tests the module under a number of different python versions, where available, or with:

    $ py.test

To execute a single test:

    $ pytest -k test_chained_exceptions_stacktrace
