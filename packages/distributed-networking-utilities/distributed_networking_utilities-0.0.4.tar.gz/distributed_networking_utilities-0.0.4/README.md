## Distributed computing patterns and utilities.

Fast inter-nodes data exchanging in a distributed setup. Implementation of
a pattern for fast data sharing (numpy arrays, json objects, etc ..) among nodes
of a distributed system configuration. Makes use of ZeroMQ and python
multiprocessing.

This projet might be usefull to construct massive processing sytems like Machine
Learning and Computer Vision setups that needs to cope with several connections
and processing requests.

DISCLAIMER: This project is under construction.
