        of a distributed system configuration. Makes use of ZeroMQ and python
        multiprocessing.
        
        This projet might be usefull to construct massive processing sytems like Machine
        Learning and Computer Vision setups that needs to cope with several connections
        and processing requests.
        
        DISCLAIMER: This project is under construction.
