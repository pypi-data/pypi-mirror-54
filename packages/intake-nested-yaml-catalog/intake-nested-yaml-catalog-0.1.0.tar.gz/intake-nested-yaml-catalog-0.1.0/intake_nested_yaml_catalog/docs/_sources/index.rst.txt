Welcome to Intake plugin for nested YAML catalogs
==================================================

This is an `Intake <https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_ plugin supporting a
single YAML hierarchical catalog to organize datasets and avoid a data swamp.

.. code-block:: yaml

    metadata:
      hierarchical_catalog: true  # required entry!
    entity:
        description: "description"
        customer:
          customer_attributes:
            args:
              urlpath: s3://foo
            driver: parquet
        user:
          user_profile:
            args:
              urlpath: s3://foo
            driver: parquet

Can be accessed as

.. code-block:: python

  df = cat.entity.customer.customer_attributes.read()
