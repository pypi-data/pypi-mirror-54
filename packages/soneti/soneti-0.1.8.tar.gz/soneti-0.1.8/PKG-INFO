Description: # Soneti Orchestrator
        
        Orchestration of Soneti services (i.e. Senpy, GSICrawler, Scaner, etc.).
        The orchestration is based on the luigi daemon, a set of custom luigi tasks, and some additional code to provide scheduling.
        
        This repository contains:
        
        * A python package with several custom luigi tasks for the main Soneti services. The package is also available through PyPI (`pip install soneti`).
        * A base image with luigi and the scripts to schedule tasks.
        * An **example orchestrator** in the `example` folder.
