        Bored of not having a good SQL linter that works with whichever dialiect you're
        working with? Fluff is an extensible and modular linter designed to help you write
        good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits your database.
        
        > **Sqlfluff** is still in an open alpha phase - expect the tool to change significantly
        > over the coming months, and expect potentially non-backward compatable api changes
        > to happen at any point.
        
        # Getting Started
        
        To get started just install the package, make a sql file and then run sqlfluff and point it at the file.
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install sqlfluff
        $ echo "  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  " > test.sql
        $ sqlfluff lint test.sql
        == [test.sql] FAIL
        L:   1 | P:   1 | L003 | Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4
        L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
        L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        For more details on usage see the docs on github [here](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank/sqlfluff/blob/master/DOCS.md).
        
        # Progress
        
        There's lots to do in this project, and we're just getting started.

        ## [0.0.9] - 2019-10-31
        ### Changed
        - Changed unicode handling for better escape codes in python 2.
          Thanks [@mrshu](https://github.com/mrshu)

          Thanks [@mrshu](https://github.com/mrshu)
        
        ## [0.0.7] - 2018-11-19
        ### Added
        - Added a `sqlfluff fix` as a command to implement auto-fixing of linting
          errors. For now only `L001` is implemented as a rule that can fix things.
        - Added a `rules` command to introspec the available rules.
        - Updated the cli table function to use the `testwrap` library and also
          deal a lot better with longer values.
        - Added a `--rules` argument to most of the commands to allow rule users
          to focus their search on a specific subset of rules.
        
        ### Changed
        - Refactor the cli tests to use the click CliRunner. Much faster
        
        ## [0.0.6] - 2018-11-15
        ### Added
        - Number matching
        
        ### Changed
        - Fixed operator parsing and linting (including allowing the exception of `(*)`)
        
        ## [0.0.5] - 2018-11-15
        ### Added
        - Much better documentation including the DOCS.md

        - Added tests for operator regexes
        - Added ability to initialise the memory in rules
        
        ## [0.0.3] - 2018-11-14
        ### Added
        - Refactor of rules to allow rules with memory
        - Adding comma linting rules (correcting the single character matchers)
        - Adding mixed indentation linting rules
        - Integration with CircleCI, CodeCov and lots of badges
        
        ### Changed
        - Changed import of version information to fix bug with importing config.ini
        - Added basic violations/file reporting for some verbosities
        - Refactor of rules to simplify definition
        - Refactor of color cli output to make it more reusable
