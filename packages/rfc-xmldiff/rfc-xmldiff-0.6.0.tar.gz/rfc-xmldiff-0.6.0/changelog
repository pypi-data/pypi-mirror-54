xmldiff (0.5.0) distribution(s); urgency=low

	* Many different css changes applied.  Changes include: resize the different columns,
	  add background coloration, wrap lines and make the tree leafs of variable height,
	  change the charset to allow Utf-8 characters.  Long term should point to the column change code,
	  but currently I don't know of a good place.
	* Format paragraphs as a single node in the tree rather than spreading them out over the tree
	  structure.  This improves readability substantially.
	* Force the matching of some v2 and v3 elements which provide equivalent functionality, but have
	  different names.
	* Include comments as nodes in the displayed tree.
	* Fix some errors in the tree merging code so that elements are placed in the correct location.
	* Need to separate the left/right class tagging from the li element as it gets clobbered by the
	  tree code.  Thus the addition of span elements all over the place.
	* Clean up some memory leaks in the distance algorithm.
