        Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library
        built on PyTorch. Notably, it was designed with these principles in
        mind:
        
        -  **Universal**: Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any
           computable probability distribution.
        -  **Scalable**: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead
           compared to hand-written code.
        -  **Minimal**: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a
           small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
        -  **Flexible**: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when
           you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to
           express generative and inference models, while allowing experts
           easy-access to customize inference.
        
        Pyro is in a beta release. It is developed and maintained by `Uber AI
        Labs <http://uber.ai>`__ and community contributors. For more

        Installing
        ----------
        
        Installing a stable Pyro release
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        **Install using pip:**
        
        Pyro supports Python 3.4+.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install pyro-ppl
        
        **Install from source:**
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           git clone git@github.com:pyro-ppl/pyro.git
           cd pyro
           git checkout master  # master is pinned to the latest release
           pip install .
        
        **Install with extra packages:**
        
        To install the dependencies required to run the probabilistic models
        included in the ``examples``/``tutorials`` directories, please use the
        following command:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install pyro-ppl[extras] 
        
        Make sure that the models come from the same release version of the
        `Pyro source code <https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/releases>`__ as you
        have installed.
        
        Installing Pyro dev branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For recent features you can install Pyro from source.
        
        **Install using pip:**
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git
        
        or, with the ``extras`` dependency to run the probabilistic models
        included in the ``examples``/``tutorials`` directories:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           pip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git#egg=project[extras]
        
        **Install from source:**
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           git clone https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro
           cd pyro
           pip install .  # pip install .[extras] for running models in examples/tutorials
        
        Running Pyro from a Docker Container
