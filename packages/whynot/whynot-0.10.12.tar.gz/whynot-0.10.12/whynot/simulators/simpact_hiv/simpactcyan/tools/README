CompileSimpact.sh is a bash script that downloads a SimpactCyan version, as
well as the GSL and TIFF libraries, and installs them in 
$HOME/SimpactCyanBuild. This can be helpful if you need to compile a version
from source, for example on a supercomputer.

comparesettings.py is a python script that can be used to compare the output
and speed of different executables. This is useful to see that the changes 
you made did not affect the output of a simulation with specific settings, or
that it did not slow things down.
