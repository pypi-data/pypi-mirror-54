First thing to check if there's a difference between the basic version
and the optimized version: are these compatible?

	double calculateInternalTimeInterval(const SimpactPopulation &population, double t0, double dt);
	double solveForRealTimeInterval(const SimpactPopulation &population, double Tdiff, double t0);
