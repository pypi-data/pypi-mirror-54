Build installation packages for different operating systems
===========================================================

OS X 
----

This uses the script `build-osx.py` to which a single argument must be 
specified. This must be the path or URL to a file like 
`simpact-cyan-0.19.6.tar.gz`. 

To make sure that the `gcc`compiler is used instead of the `clang` compiler
(which is the one provided by OS X), the Anaconda Python environment needs to 
be installed, and the PATH environment variable must be set in such a way that
the `conda` command can be executed.

To create the final .dmg installer, the tool `packagesbuild` (available
from http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html) is used, and
therefore needs to be installed.

MS-Windows build
----------------

To automate the creation of an installer on MS-Windows, some things will need
to be available:

 - The Visual Studio 2015 compiler needs to be installed to compile the 
   Simpact binaries
 - CMake needs to be installed
 - NSIS (a tool to create an installer) needs to be available
 - Some additional libraries (for GSL and TIFF libraries) from
   http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/simpact_vs2015_deps.rar need to
   be extracted somewhere and the `32bit/bin` subdirectory needs to be
   added to the PATH environment variable

The script `build-windows.py` accepts either the path/URL to a filename like
`simpact-cyan-0.19.6.tar.gz`, or a directory that points to the main 
`CMakeLists.txt` file.

Linux build
-----------

To create a .deb or .rpm file for a particular Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora, you
can run the `build-debian.py` (for Debian and Ubuntu) or `build-windows.py`
script. These scripts accept either the path/URL to a filename like
`simpact-cyan-0.19.6.tar.gz`, or a directory that points to the main 
`CMakeLists.txt` file.

To create .deb and .rpm installers for many systems using a single command,
the `build-linuxpacks-using-vagrant.py` script can be used. This uses
the `vagrant` tool to start virtual machines with different Linux-based 
operating systems, which in turn will launch the `build-debian.py` or
`build-fedora.py` scripts automatically.

The `build-linuxpacks-using-vagrant.py` script needs the path/URL to a file
like `simpact-cyan-0.19.6.tar.gz` as a first parameter, and one or more 
parameters that specify which installers should be created. Run the
`build-linuxpacks-using-vagrant.py` script without parameters to see
what's possible.
