The 'checkdoc.py' program runs 

    simpact-cyan-release --showconfigoptions

and

    maxart-release --showconfigoptions

to get a list of all options that should have documentation.

It compares this list with the one from the *.rst files: it reads each
such file, and if it begins with "- ``" and ends with ": |br|", e.g.

     - ``monitoring.cd4.threshold`` (350.0): |br|

it is considered to be an explanation of a config option.

The script then compares the lists and reports the options that are present
in the executables but have no documentation, as well a the options that
are documented but are not (or no longer) used in the executable.
