Description: # pycodegraph - Python code graphing tool
        
        A tool/framework for analysing and graphing Python code.
        
        Currently only supports graphing of imports, but hopefully more to come.
        
        ## Installing
        
        Install via pip (preferably into your project's virtualenv):
        
        	pip install pycodegraph
        
        ## Usage
        
        Create a dot graph of your code and render it using dot:
        
        	pycodegraph imports --depth=1 ./my_code | dot -Tsvg > mygraph.svg
        
        Usually you'll want to adjust the depth depending on project size and/or number of submodules.
        
        There is also `--include` and `--exclude` for more fine grained control over what gets included in the graph.
