Description: 
        Neet is a python package designed to provide an easy-to-use API for creating and evaluating network
        models. In its current state, Neet supports simulating synchronous Boolean network models, though
        the API is designed to be model generic. Future work will implement asynchronous update mechanisms
        and more general network types.
