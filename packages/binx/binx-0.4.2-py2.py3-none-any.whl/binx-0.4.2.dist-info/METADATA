:version: 0.4.2


``binx`` is a small Python framework for application data modeling and transformation. It's API relies heavily on `marshmallow
<https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/>`_ for validation, object serialization and storage. It's true purpose however is to expose an API that
allows developers to model procedural code into directed, acyclic graphs of arbitrary complexity. A user can define an application or library as a
family of ``binx.Collection`` objects (nodes) and use the ``binx.adapter`` module (edges) to create a network of data transformations while
guaranteeing data integrity along the way.

The main goal of the project is to provide a simple API for data scientists, engineers or developers who write alot of procedural code
to be able to organize their projects using a declarative style similar to how one might approach writing a web application using DRY principles.

Features
--------

This set of interfaces are designed to help you quickly scale up your notebooks/scripts and create uniformity between your projects!

binx provides:

* A declarative style in memory datastore (collections.py)
* A declarative ``Adapter`` API that helps model/manage relationships and data transformations between collections (adapter.py)
* consistent API for moving your data between json, py-objs, and pandas dataframes



=======
History
=======

0.1.2 (2018-05-28)
------------------
* Port initial API from bema project
* Port original unittests
* change marshmallow api to 2.x


0.2.0 (2018-07-03)
------------------
* Built adapter module and related functionality
* removed calc_factory API (possibly will be re-included in a later build)
* created the CollectionBuilder class


0.2.1 (2018-07-12)
------------------
* patched issue relating to datetime/datestrings not being parsed by collections

0.2.2 (2018-07-26)
------------------
* patched issue relating to introspection of required columns (issue #7-#8)

0.2.3 (2018-10-01)
------------------
* clean up and fixes to cli

0.3.0 (2019-07-14)
------------------
Fixes some long standing issues and adds some new features.

* adapter.py - kwarg to accumulate optionally accumulate intermediate collections in adapter chain
* registry.py - A user warning is issued instead of exception if an identical class path name is overwritten
* collection.py - fixed errors related to creating dataframes from NoneType
* adapter.py - added a new base class PluggableAdapter to ease development of the adapter chain
* collection.py - CollectionBuilder.build now excepts an optional name arg. Will attempt to auto-parse name from serializer_class.


0.3.1 (2019-07-15)
------------------

* Adds a context variable to the AdapterChainError that can be accessed if the error is caught


0.3.2 (2019-08-21)
------------------
Final release that is compatible with marshmallow 2.x

* Pins marshmallow to v0.20.2
* Final release supporting marshmallow 2.x functionality


0.4.0 (2019-08-23)
------------------
A minor release that internally breaks backward compatibility with marshmallow-2.x. Adds new feature
to that allows loading data and setting ma configuration directly from Collection constructor.

* private api changes to Serializer and Collection classes.
* data can now be loaded via the Collection constructor.
* kwargs can be passed to the underlying ma schema at runtime.


0.4.1 (2019-09-23)
------------------
A patch that pins the library to marshmallow-v3.1.1


0.4.2 (2019-10-27)
------------------
Bugfix that fixes the dependency in the previous patch. This version is compatible with marshmallow>=3.1.1.
Also assures pandas>=0.23 in setup.py
