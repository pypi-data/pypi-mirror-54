        ## Extending a Protocol Buffer
        
        - You **must not** change the tag numbers of any existing fields.
        - You **must not** add or delete any required fields.
        - You **may** delete optional or repeated fields.
        - You **may** add new optional or repeated fields but you must use fresh tag numbers (i.e. tag numbers that were never used in this protocol buffer, not even by deleted fields).
        
        For further details see [protobuf docs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial#extending-a-protocol-buffer)
