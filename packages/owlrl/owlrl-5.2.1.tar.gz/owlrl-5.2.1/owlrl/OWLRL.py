"""
This module is a **brute force** implementation of the OWL 2 RL profile.

RDFLib works with 'generalized' RDF, meaning that triples with a BNode predicate are *allowed*. This is good because,
e.g., some of the triples generated for RDF from an OWL 2 functional syntax might look like :code:`[ owl:inverseOf p ]`, and the
RL rules would then operate on such generalized triple. However, as a last, post processing steps, these triples are 
removed from the graph before serialization to produce 'standard' RDF (which is o.k. for RL, too, because the 
consequent triples are all right, generalized triples might have had a role in the deduction steps only).

**Requires**: `RDFLib`_, 4.0.0 and higher.

    OWL 2 RL Semantics class, i.e., implementation of the OWL 2 RL closure graph.

    .. note:: Note that the module does *not* implement the so called Datatype entailment rules, simply because the underlying
        RDFLib does not implement the datatypes (i.e., RDFLib will not make the literal "1.00" and "1.00000" identical,
        although even with all the ambiguities on datatypes, this *should* be made equal...).

        Also, the so-called extensional entailment rules (Section 7.3.1 in the RDF Semantics document) have not been
        implemented either.

    The comments and references to the various rule follow the names as used in the `OWL 2 RL
