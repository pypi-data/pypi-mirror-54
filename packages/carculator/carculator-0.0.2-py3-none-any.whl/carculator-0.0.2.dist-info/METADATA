Description: # Carculator
        
        A parameterized Python model to calculate the life cycle material and energy requirements of passenger cars.
        
        Integrates well with [Brightway](https://brightwaylca.org/) and [presamples](https://github.com/PascalLesage/brightway2-presamples).
        
        Extracted from [Uncertain environmental footprint of current and future battery electric vehicles by Cox, et al (2018)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.8b00261).
