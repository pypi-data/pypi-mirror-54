    Args:
	*df_column: list(float). A single list of numeric time series data points.
	*length_of_interval: even int. the length of the interval to search for a change point. If a change point is not found within the interval, then the algorithm searches again, this time including half the original interval. For example, if the length_of_interval=20 and len(df_column)=50, assuming there is no change point, the algorithm will search intervals 0-19, 10-29, 20-39, 30-49. If there are change points detected at points 8 and 32, the algorithm will search 0-20, 8-27, 18-37, 32-49. (default 20)
	*specified_confidence_level: float (0.0,1.0). The confidence level which the change point is detected. (default 0.95)
	*niterations: int > 10. The number of bootstrapping iterations in the CUMSUM algorithms (default 100)
	*acc: boolean. If True, df_column time series points will be subtacted from their previous points, obtaining the 'velocity' of the time series. The change point detection algorithm is used on the 'velocity'. (default False)
	*rank: boolean. If True, time series points within the change point analysis are ranked by value and the algorithm is used on the ranked time series data. (default False)
	
    Returns:
	*change_point_indices: list(int). returns a list of indices where change points are found. The last index and first index are always included as change points.

    Make sure the directions are going in the proper position after the smoothing and the change_point_loop.
	
    Args:
	*direction_column: list(int). The bit_depth_change column obtained from the bit_depth_change function, direction_smoother function or the change_point_loop function.
	*df_column: list(float). The original df_column used in the change_point_detection function.
	*p_threshhold: float (0.0,1.0). The p-value determining whether the time series is increasing or decreasing. (default 0.05)
	*avg_threshhold: float > 0. If the statistic is less than the p_threshhold, then the interval is increasing or decreasing. The absolute average of the slope must be greater than the avg_threshhold to be increasing or decreasing. (default 0)
	
    Returns:
	*direction_column: list(int). Returns a list the size of the provided direction_column that correlates with the slope observed at that location. If -1, the slope is decreasing. If 0, the slope is constant. If 1, the slope is increasing.
