        Metadrive helps control information from different Internet resources
        (e.g. `Linkedin <https://linkedin.com>`__,
        `Halfbakery <https://www.halfbakery.com>`__, etc). It provides one API
        to rule them all at the operating system filesystem level, via allowing
        to mount and syncing web resources, as if they are disks (mounted
        filesystems) on your operating system. To gather the information from a
        specific resource, there must be so called driver written specifically
        for the resource. There are drivers which already exist. For example, \*
        Halfbakery:
        `halfbakery_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/halfbakery_driver>`__
        \* Linkedin:
        `linkedin_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/linkedin_driver>`__ \*
        Metaculus:
        `metaculus_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/metaculus_driver>`__ \*
        HTH Worldwide:
        `hthworld_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/hthworld_driver>`__ \*
        Kompass:
        `kompass_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/kompass_driver>`__ \*
        ResearchGate:
        `researchgate_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/researchgate_driver>`__
        \* Versli Lietuva:
        `verslilietuva_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/verslilietuva_driver>`__
        
        Many drivers are awaiting to be implemented at
        [drivernet][https://github.com/drivernet]. Studying the Metadrive will
        help developers to write the drivers for those resources which are
        needed them right now. A unified API is the killer feature of Metadrive
        and allows writing drivers to have a unified UI to the whole world.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        The guide provides for the instructions on how to install Metadrive to a
        virtual environment, so create and activate it first, running the
        following commands:
        
        ::
        
           virtualenv -p python3 metadrive-env
           . ./metadrive-env/bin/activate
        
        Then, install Metadrive from its source code
        
        ::
        
           git clone https://github.com/wefindx/metadrive.git
           cd metadrive
           pip install -e .
        
        or from its package
        
        ::
        
           pip install metadrive
        
        Finally, run Metadrive, executing
        
        ::
        
           connect <resource>
        
        The command above will ask you to type your GitHub username. When you
        are done, the ``.metadrive/config`` will be created in your home
        directory and the server will start. The example of how
        ``.metadrive/config`` may look like:
        
        ::
        
           [GITHUB]
           username = mindey

        Installing drivers
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Drivers are automatically installed, when a drive is requested and a
        driver exists.
