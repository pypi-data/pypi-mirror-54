Welcome to zask's documentation!
================================

Zask is a framework to work with ZeroRPC. Zask is inspired by Flask, you can consider zask as Flask without ``WSGI``, ``Jinja2`` and ``Router`` but with ZeroRPC and SqlAlchemy. 

Why not Flask
-------------

Flask is designed for web application, but Zask is for internal service application.
