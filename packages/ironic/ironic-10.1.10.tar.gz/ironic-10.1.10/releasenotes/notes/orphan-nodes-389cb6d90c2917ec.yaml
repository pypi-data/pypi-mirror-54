fixes:
  - |
    On node take over, any locks that are left from the old conductor are
    cleared by the new one. Previously it only happened for nodes in
    ``DEPLOYING`` state.
  - |
    On taking over nodes in ``CLEANING`` state, the new conductor moves them
    to ``CLEAN FAIL`` and set maintenance.
