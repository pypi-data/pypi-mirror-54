    Fixes a bug to get a node stuck in ``deploying`` state when the size of
    the configdrive exceeds the limitation of the database. In MySQL, the
    limitation is about 64KiB. With this fix, the provision state gets
    ``deploy failed`` in this case. See `bug 1745630
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1745630>`_ for details.
