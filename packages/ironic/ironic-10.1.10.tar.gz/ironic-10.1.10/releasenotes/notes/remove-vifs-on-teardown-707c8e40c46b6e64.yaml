    The behavior for retention of VIF interface attachments has changed.

    If your use of the BareMetal service is reliant upon the behavior of
    the VIFs being retained, which was introduced as a behavior change
    during the Ocata cycle, then you must update your tooling to explicitly
    re-add the VIF attachments prior to deployment.
fixes:
  - |
    Removes all records of VIF attachments upon the teardown of a deployed
    node. This is in order to resolve issues related to where it is
    operationally impossible in some circumstances to remove a VIF
    attachment while a node is being undeployed as the Compute service
    will only attempt to remove the VIF for five minutes.

    See `bug 1743652 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1743652>`_ for more details.
