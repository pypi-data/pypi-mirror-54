# Python interface to the Binaryen library

This module provides a Python interface to the
[binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) webassembly library.

That library has to be installed separately so it is available on your system as a shared library.

*Requires Python 3.5 or newer.  Also works on pypy3 (because it uses cffi).* 

Software license for these Python bindings: MIT
