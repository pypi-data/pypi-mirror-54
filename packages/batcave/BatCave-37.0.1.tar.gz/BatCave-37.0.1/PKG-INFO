Description: BatCave Python Module
        =====================
        A useful collection of tools for writing Python programs.
        
        Developing
        ----------
        Development is best accomplished using pipenv where a virtual environment can be generated from the Pipfile using::
        
            pipenv install --dev
        
        Building
        --------
        Building is performed by changing to the Build directory and running the build.py script which will perform two actions
        
        1. run the unit tests and place the results in Build/unit_test_results/junit.xml
        1. run the setup.py to create a PyPi distribution in Build/artifacts
        
        Test Publish
        ------------
        A test can be published to the PyPi test site with::
        
            build.py --test-publish
        
        This will use twine to publish which will prompt for the username and password.
        If you create a password with keyring you can specify the username on the command line with the "--user username" argument.
        If you need to test publish with a new version number you can use the "--release number" argument
        
        Publishing a Release
        --------------------
        After updating Changelog.rst A release can be published to PyPi with::
        
            build.py --publish
