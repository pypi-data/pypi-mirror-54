        The following command line tools are provided:
        
            ucinfo
                writes on stdout the name of each unicode character read from stdin
        
            ucenum
                enumerates on stdout all unicode characters of a chosen category
        
        ucinfo
        ------
        
        The ucinfo tool reads UTF-8 text from stdin and writes to stdout information
        about each character, one per line.
        The output has 5 tab-separated columns:
        
            1. the character itself, if printable, or an escaped representation of it
            2. the decimal codepoint of the character
            3. the number of bytes that the character occupies
            4. the Unicode category of the character
            5. the Unicode name of the character
        
        ucenum
        ------
        
        The ucenum tool takes a category abbreviation as argument and outputs a list
         of all characters belonging to that category.  The categories are:
