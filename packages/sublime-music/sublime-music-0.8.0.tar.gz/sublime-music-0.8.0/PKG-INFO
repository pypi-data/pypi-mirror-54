        Development Setup
        -----------------
        
        Requirements:
        
        - Python 3.7
        - GTK3
        - GLib
        - Probably other things... Please create an MR with any other dependencies that
          you had to install to develop the app.
        
        Install the Sublime Music app locally (commands may differ from what is
        described below, this is merely an outline)::
        
            pip install -e . --user
            pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
        
        Building the flatpak
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - A flatpak-builder environment must be setup on the build machine to do a
          flatpak build. This includes ``org.gnome.SDK//3.32`` and
          ``org.gnome.Platform//3.32``.
        - The ``flatpak`` folder contains the required files to build a flatpak package.
        - The repository must be cloned to include submodules as they are used to manage
          some flatpak dependencies.
        - The script ``flatpak_build.sh`` will run the required commands to grab the
          remaining dependencies and build the flatpak.
