class ShuffleIterator(Iterable[Sample], Sized):
    r"""Iterator that shuffles the samples before iterating.

    When ``key`` is not given, this iterator performs ordinary shuffling using
    `random.shuffle`. Otherwise, a noisy sorting is performed. The samples are
    sorted ascending by the value of the given key, plus some random noise
    :math:`\epsilon \sim` Uniform :math:`(-z, z)`, where :math:`z` equals ``scale``
    times the standard deviation of key values. This formulation means that ``scale``
    regulates how noisy the sorting is. The larger it is, the more noisy the sorting
    becomes, i.e. it resembles random shuffling more closely. In an extreme case
    where ``scale=0``, this method just sorts the samples by ``key``. This method is
    useful when working with text data, where we want to shuffle the dataset and also
    minimize padding by ensuring that sentences of similar lengths are not too far apart.

    Example:

        >>> from text2array import ShuffleIterator
        >>> samples = [
        ...   {'ws': ['a', 'b', 'b']},
        ...   {'ws': ['a']},
        ...   {'ws': ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b']},
        ... ]
        >>> iter_ = ShuffleIterator(samples, key=lambda s: len(s['ws']))
        >>> for s in iter_:
        ...   print(s)
        ...
        {'ws': ['a']}
        {'ws': ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b']}
        {'ws': ['a', 'b', 'b']}

    Args:
        samples (~typing.Sequence[Sample]): Sequence of samples to shuffle and iterate over.
        key (typing.Callable[[Sample], int]): Callable to get the key value of a
            given sample.
        scale: Value to regulate the noise of the sorting. Must not be negative.
        rng: Random number generator to use for shuffling. Set this to ensure reproducibility.
            If not given, an instance of `~random.Random` with the default seed is used.
