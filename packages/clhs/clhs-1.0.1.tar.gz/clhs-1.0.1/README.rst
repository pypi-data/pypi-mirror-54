Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling in Python.

This code is based on the conditioned LHS method of
`Minasny & McBratney (2006)`_. It follows some of the code from the R package
clhs_ of Roudier et al.

In short, this code attempts to create a Latin Hypercube sample by selecting
only from input data. It uses simulated annealing to force the sampling to
converge more rapidly, and also allows for setting a stopping criterion on
the objective function described in Minasny & McBratney (2006).
