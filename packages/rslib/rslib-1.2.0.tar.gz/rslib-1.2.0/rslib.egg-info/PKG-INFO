        [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform
        for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of
        [tools](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools),
        [libraries](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions), and
        [community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community) resources that lets
        researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and
        deploy ML powered applications.
        
        TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the
        Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization for
        the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research.
        The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other
        domains, as well.
        
        TensorFlow provides stable [Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
        and [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc) APIs, as well as
        non-guaranteed backwards compatible API for
        [other languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs).

        ## Install
        
        See the [TensorFlow install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for the
        [pip package](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip), to
        [enable GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu), use a
        [Docker container](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker), and
        [build from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source).
        
        To install the current release for CPU-only:
        
        ```
        $ pip install tensorflow
        ```
