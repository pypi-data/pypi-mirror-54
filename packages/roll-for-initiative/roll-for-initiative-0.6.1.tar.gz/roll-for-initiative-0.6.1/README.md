# Roll for Initiative!

## What is this?
All initiative trackers I found only are bloated. They claim to have a bunch of features, and no doubt they do.
But the interface is filled with buttons and clunky UX. I'm going back to the basics: a CLI tool to manage
initiative. No "create encounter". No "what is this creature's initiative bonus?". No dice roller.

## Flow
What I expect the user to do is something like:

Enter a name.  
Enter a number.  
(Repeat)  
Done? Start!

Next.  
Next.  
Next.

New monster!  
Enter a name.  
Enter a number.  

Next.  
Next.  
...

## Rationale

I **HATE** the "create encounter" feature of these initiative trackers. I admit, this might be due to my GM style,
but I don't want to plan every single encounter the night before. I don't know what my players will do, I need the
flexibility to improvise.

So the main motivation for me to create this, really, is just so I have a clean interface with really shallow menus
and **no setup time**. This is the project philosophy. If this ever grows and pull requests start coming, only those
which adhere to the original ideas will be considered.

You can fork and do what you want on your end. This project is mainly for me and GMs that think like me.
