    files containing arrays, i.e., .mat files created by Matlab or .npz files created by numpy

    Each file should contain a spectrogram as a matrix and two vectors associated with it, a
    vector of frequency bins and time bins, where the values in those vectors are the values
    at the bin centers. (As far as vak is concerned, "vector" and "matrix" are synonymous with
    "array".)

    Since both .mat files and .npz files load into a dictionary-like structure,
    the arrays will be accessed with keys. By convention, these keys are 's', 'f', and 't'.
    If you use different keys you can let this function know by changing
    the appropriate arguments: spect_key, freqbins_key, timebins_key

    Parameters
    ----------
    spect_format : str
        format of files containing spectrograms. One of {'mat', 'npz'}
    spect_dir : str
        path to directory of files containing spectrograms as arrays.
        Default is None.
    spect_files : list
        List of paths to array files. Default is None.
    annot_list : list
        of annotations for array files. Default is None.
    spect_annot_map : dict
        Where keys are paths to files and value corresponding to each key is
        the annotation for that file.
        Default is None.
    labelset : list
        of str or int, set of unique labels for vocalizations. Default is None.
        If not None, skip files where the associated annotations contain labels not in labelset.
    load_spects : bool
        if True, load spectrograms. If False, return a VocalDataset without spectograms loaded.
        Default is True. Set to False when you want to create a VocalDataset for use
        later, but don't want to load all the spectrograms into memory yet.
    n_decimals_trunc : int
        number of decimal places to keep when truncating the timebin duration calculated from
        the vector of time bins.
        Default is 3, i.e. assumes milliseconds is the last significant digit.
    freqbins_key : str
        key for accessing vector of frequency bins in files. Default is 'f'.
    timebins_key : str
        key for accessing vector of time bins in files. Default is 't'.
    spect_key : str
        key for accessing spectrogram in files. Default is 's'.
    audio_path_key : str
        key for accessing path to source audio file for spectogram in files.
        Default is 'audio_path'.
