    """class to represent a spectrogram and 'metadata' associated with it,
    such as the vectors of frequency and time bin centers, and things that

    Will typically correspond to a single file, e.g. a .mat or .npz file that
    contains the spectrogram and associated arrays.

    Attributes
    ----------
    spect : numpy.ndarray
        spectrogram contained in an array
    freq_bins : numpy.ndarray
        vector of frequencies in spectrogram, where each value is a bin center.
    time_bins : numpy.ndarray
        vector of times in spectrogram, where each value is a bin center.
    audio_path : str
        path to audio file from which spectrogram was generated
    timebin_dur : numpy.ndarray
        duration of a timebin in seconds from spectrogram
    lbl_tb : numpy.ndarray
        labeled time bins, i.e. result of taking labels, onsets and offsets of
        segments from some annotation file and then converting them into a vector
        using the `vak.utils.labels.label_timebin` function

        spect_key : str
            key for accessing spectrogram in files. Default is 's'.
        timebin_dur : float
            duration of time bins. Default is None. If None, then
        n_decimals_trunc : int
            number of decimal places to keep when truncating the timebin duration calculated from
