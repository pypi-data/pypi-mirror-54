Introduction
============

It's important, that this package isn't started by conjob in non productive
deployments. This is due to the fact, that the command is started by a zope
ctl command.

Compatibility
-------------

Plone 4.3.x


Installation
============

- Add the package to your buildout configuration:

::

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        ...
        ftw.linkchecker


One needs to add a config file (e.g. linkchecker_config.json) holding:

- portal path (unique identifier of the platform)
- emails of the platforms administrator (the ones who gets the report)
- base URI (domain where the platform is configured)
- timeout in seconds (how long the script waits for each external link before
  continuing if the page does not respond).
- upload_location can be left empty. It is the path to a file listing
  block where the report will be uploaded.

::

    {
      "/portal/path-one": {
        "email": ["first_site_admin@example.com", "first_site_keeper@example.com"],
        "base_uri": "http://example1.ch",
        "timeout_config": "1",
        "upload_location": "/content_page/my_file_listing_block"
      },
      "/portal/path-two": {
        "email": ["second_site_admin@example.com"],
        "base_uri": "http://example2.ch",
        "timeout_config": "1"
      }
    }
