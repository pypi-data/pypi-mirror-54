    triple: subject, predicate, object
    finding the triple of a sentence:
    this is done by using the dependency tree of the sentence
    a dependency tree shows the relation between the words of a sentence
    the finite verb (predicate) is the structural center of the sentence and therefor of the tree
    so starting with the predicate the algorithm searches through the dependency tree to find subject and object
    -> triple_search()

    examples:
    - How are you?
     tree depth = 1     predicate: "are"
                            -> relation to "how": adverbial modifier (advmod) => object of this sentence
                            -> relation to "you": nominal subject (nsubj) => subject of this sentence

    - How old are you?
    tree depth = 2      predicate: "are"
                            -> relation to "old": adjectival complement (acomp) => auxiliary predicate
                                -> relation to "how":  adverbial modifier (advmod) => object of this sentence
                            -> relation to "you": nominal subject (nsubj) => subject of this sentence

    - Who is your father?
    tree depth = 2      predicate: "is"
                            -> relation to "who": nominal subject (nsubj) => subject of this sentence
                            -> relation to "father": attribute (attr) => object of this sentence
                                    ->relation to "your": possession modifier (poss)
