<h1>Timing and empirical testing of Expyriment<a class="headerlink" href="#timing-and-empirical-testing-of-expyriment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>How accurate is the timing in Expyriment?</strong></p>
<p>In general, the Expyriment clock can feature up to 1 ms accuracy. The exact
timing, however, is subject to various factors, which we discuss here.</p>
<p>Time and compatibility issues can be conveniently tested using the
<a class="reference internal" href="Testsuite.html"><span class="doc">Expyriment test suite</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="visual">
<h3>Visual<a class="headerlink" href="#visual" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Computer screens are updated according to their refresh rate. What happens then
is that the whole screen is redrawn line by line all the time. For example,
with a refresh rate of 60Hz, the screen is redrawn 60 times per second (1000ms)
and the duration it takes to redraw it line by line is 16.66 ms (1000/60).
When attempting to redraw the screen while it is currently already being
updated (the lines are drawn) the result might lead to artifacts, since the
update occurs immediately, leading to parts of both, the new and the old screen
content, being visible. What is even worse is that you will never know in which
phase of the redrawing the new redraw was started. Thus, you cannot be sure
when exactly the new content is fully visible on screen. This should be the
behaviour of Expyriment, when OpenGL is switched off
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control.defaults.open_gl=0</span></code>; see <a class="reference internal" href="Defaults.html"><span class="doc">Defaults (settings)</span></a>)</p>
<p>The first step towards getting around this problem is to synchronize the actual
redraw to the vertical retrace of the screen. This means that a change in
content will never happen immediately, but always only when the retrace is at
the top left position. When synchronizing to the vertical retrace, the graphic
card is told to update the screen the next time it starts redrawing the first
line. This should be the behaviour of Expyriment, when OpenGL is switched on
and set to “vsync / no blocking” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control.defaults.open_gl=1</span></code>; see <a class="reference internal" href="Defaults.html"><span class="doc">Defaults (settings)</span></a>).
While this will solve the problem of artifacts, you will still face the
problem of not knowing when exactly something was visible on the screen, since
the graphic card handles this synchronization itself in the background.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is the exact (and only) reason why Expyriment will use
OpenGL set to “vsync / blocking” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control.defaults.open_gl=2</span></code>; see <a class="reference internal" href="Defaults.html"><span class="doc">Defaults (settings)</span></a>) by default.
It allows to wait for the vertical retrace to actually happen before
proceeding with the code that tells the graphics card to update the screen
(this is also known as blocking on the vertical retrace). This means that
whenever something should be presented on screen, no matter in which line the
redraw is at this point in time, the graphic card will wait for the redraw to
be in the first line and then present the stimulus. Since the code is
blocking, the time Expyriment reports the stimulus to be presented on screen
will always be the time when the redraw is starting at the first line.
Coming back to the example of the small dot in the center of the screen:
Expyriment will correctly report a longer presentation time when the redraw
has been just over the center line when the screen update was issued.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, this blocking mechanism will not work. This is due to
specifics of the video card driver implementation. Should blocking on the
vertical retrace indeed not work (as can be revealed by the
<a class="reference internal" href="Testsuite.html"><span class="doc">Expyriment test suite</span></a>), an alternative blocking mechanism
is available by using OpenGL set to “vsync / alternative blocking”
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control.defaults.open_gl=3</span></code>; see <a class="reference internal" href="Defaults.html"><span class="doc">Defaults (settings)</span></a>).</p>
<p><em>It is important to set your graphic card’s driver settings to support
synchronizing to the vertical retrace (“Sync to VBlank” or “V-sync”) and to
switch off any power saving schemes on the graphic card.</em>
<em>Also, please be aware that blocking on the vertical retrace is not accurate
in window mode!</em></p>
<p><strong>Test results</strong></p>
<p>We tested the visual timing by presented a white and a black fullscreen
rectangle directly after each other. The brightness of the left upper edge of
the screen was recorded using an optic sensor attached to an oscilloscope.
After each screen presentation, a marker was send via the serial port to the
oscilloscope. Testing was done on an Intel Core Duo PC with an Nvidia Quadro
NVS 290 graphics card, running Microsoft Windows XP SP3. The monitor used was a
Samsung SyncMaster 2233. Expyriment was running in the default OpenGL mode
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control.defaults.open_gl=2</span></code>; see <a class="reference internal" href="Defaults.html"><span class="doc">Defaults (settings)</span></a>).</p>
<p>The results revealed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When presenting a stimulus, updating the screen does successfully block code
execution until the vertical retrace actually happens. This can be seen in
Figure 1, where the marker (yellow) lines up with the onset and offset of an
increase in brightness (turquoise) which represent the onset of the white and
the onset of the black screen, respectively.</li>
<li>Presenting (preloaded) stimuli can accurately be done each refresh rate
(Figure 2).</li>
</ul>
<p>Visual stimulus presentation is time locked to the vertical retrace.</p>

<div class="section" id="audio">
<h2>Audio<a class="headerlink" href="#audio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Playing back audio is handled by PyGame. The present() and play() methods of
auditory stimuli will return immediately. Since the audio stream has to be sent
to the hardware, there will still be a delay before the audio can be heard.
Unfortunately, the latency of the sound onset is not known by Expyriment.
However, it is assumed to be relatively stable over time. Setting the audio
buffersize to a smaller value than the default can decrease the delay, but
might result in distorted audio.</p>
<p><em>It is important to set your samplerate, bitdepth and audio buffersize
correctly. Setting the buffersize too low will result in distorted audio!</em></p>
<p><strong>Test results</strong></p>
<p>We tested the audio timing by repeatedly playing back a beep tone (a 1 second
sine wave). The output of the sound card was measured by an oscilloscope.
Before starting playback of the beep, a marker was send via the serial port to
the oscilloscope.  Testing was done on an Intel Core Duo PC with a Soundblaster
Audigy sound card, running Microsoft Windows XP SP3. In Expyriment, the
samplerate was set to 44100 Hz, bitdepth to 16 bit and the buffersize equaled 128.</p>
<p>The results revealed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Audio playback was subject to a latency of maximally 20 ms. Figure 1 shows
the maximal measured latency between the start of the playback (yellow) and
the onset of the sound (turquoise).</li>
<li>This latency was relatively stable with a jitter of 5 ms. Figure 2 shows the
minimal latency we could measure.</li>

<h3>Video<a class="headerlink" href="#video" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Video presentation is a tricky subject. In Expyriment, the present() method of
a video stimulus will start playback and present the first (current) frame on
the screen. Thus, visual onset of this frame can be synchronized with the
vertical retrace (see visual stimulus presentation above). Each following frame
has to be plotted on the screen and the screen has to be updated. The
wait_end() method of a video stimulus will automatically present each frame on
the screen until the video is over. When Expyriment is in OpenGL mode “vsync /
(alternative) blocking”, the process of plotting each frame might take longer
than one refresh rate which will result in dropping frames (e.g. frames not
being presented at all). To control for this, the wait_end() method will
report and log if any frames were dropped during video playback.</p>

<div class="section" id="measuring-user-input">
<h2>Measuring user input<a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-user-input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Expyriment all inputs (keybard, mouse, gameport, serial port, parallel port)
can be checked by directly polling them (via the wait() methods of the
corresponding io object). This allows for the most accurate timing possible.
Since Python wraps C functions for getting the system time, the accuracy is
even more precise than milliseconds (which is the unit Expyriment uses).</p>
<p>Expyriment does <em>not</em> have a main event loop (i.e. it will not automatically
check for any incoming events in the background)! This was a design decision,
since we think that in 99% of all cases the time of the user input is specified
in the design and thus know beforehand (e.g. a response after a stimulus
onset). Adding an event loop would make things unnecessarily more complicated
for those 99%.</p>
<p>However, we also thought of those cases that need to check user input during
other operations: All events can manually be pushed from either Pygame’s event
cue (keyboard, mouse, joystick) or the operating system’s buffer (serial port,
parallel port) into an EventBuffer object. Doing this regularly is up to the
user.</p>
<div class="section" id="keyboard">
<h3>Keyboard<a class="headerlink" href="#keyboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Keyboards (PS2 and USB) are known to have poor timing accuracy. Usually these
are in the range of several 100th of a second.</p>
<p><strong>Test results</strong></p>
<p>We tested the timing of a Logitec USB keyboard in Windows XP SP3 using optical
tracking.</p>
<p>Our results revealed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A timing accuracy between 20 and 26 ms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mouse">
<h3>Mouse<a class="headerlink" href="#mouse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On most operating systems, USB mice are polled at a rate of 8 ms. Mice with
special drivers might be set to poll more often.</p>
<p><strong>Test results</strong></p>
<p>We tested the mouse accuracy of a standard USB mouse on Windows XP SP3 by
measuring the time between reported position changes.</p>
<p>Our results revealed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The expected standard accuracy of 8 ms.</li>
<li>Using a Logitec G700 USB mouse with a dedicated driver, polling rates could A
be reduced, leading to an increased accuracy of 1 ms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="serial-port">
<h3>Serial port<a class="headerlink" href="#serial-port" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The serial port is very accurate and thus suited for timing accurate
measurements. If a computer does not have a serial port, USB-to-serial
converter can be used (e.g. from Sweex or Keyspan). However, the timing
accuracy of these depends on the implementation and drivers used!</p>
<p><em>It is important to deactivate any additional FIFO buffers or delays, provided
by the port driver!</em></p>
<p><strong>Test results</strong></p>
<p>We tested the timing of a UART 16550A serial port (a real one, not a
USB-to-serial converter!) on Windows XP SP3 by sending a byte to a connected
loopback device which immediately sends the byte back. We then measured the
time between sending and receiving. We repeated this process 1000 times.</p>
<p>Our results revealed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>With a baudrate of 115200, the maximal measured time between sending and
receiving a byte was 0.283894736842 ms.</li>
<li>With a baudrate of 19200, the maximal measured time between sending and
receiving a byte was 0.689593984962 ms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parallel-port">
<h3>Parallel port<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-port" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The parallel port works by directly applying a current (writing) and measuring
if a current is applied (sending) to several pins on the connector. Expyriment
is only able to read from Acknowledge, Paper-Out and Selected pins!</p>
