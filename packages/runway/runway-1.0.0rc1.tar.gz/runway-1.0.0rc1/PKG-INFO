Description: Runway
        ======
        
        What?
        -----
        
        A lightweight wrapper around linting (e.g. yamllint) & infrastructure
        deployment tools (e.g. CloudFormation, Terraform, Serverless) to ease
        management of per-environment configs & deployment.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        Very simple configuration to:
        
        -  Perform automatic linting/verification
        -  Ensure deployments are only performed when an environment config is
           present
        -  Define an IAM role to assume for each deployment
        -  Wrangle Terraform backend/workspace configs w/ per-environment tfvars
        -  Avoid long-term tool lock-in
        
           -  Runway is a simple wrapper around standard tools. It simply helps
              to avoid convoluted Makefiles/CI jobs and encourage best practices
