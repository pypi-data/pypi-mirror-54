History
-------

PyWavelets started in 2006 as an academic project for a masters thesis
on `Analysis and Classification of Medical Signals using Wavelet Transforms`
and was maintained until 2012 by its `original developer`_.  In 2013
maintenance was taken over in a `new repo <https://github.com/PyWavelets/pywt>`_)
by a larger development team - a move supported by the original developer.
The repo move doesn't mean that this is a fork - the package continues to be
developed under the name "PyWavelets", and released on PyPI and Github (see
`this issue <https://github.com/nigma/pywt/issues/13>`_ for the discussion
where that was decided).
