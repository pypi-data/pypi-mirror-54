[Stegano](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/Stegano), a pure Python
Steganography module.

Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way
that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the
existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity. Consequently,
functions provided by Stegano only hide messages, without encryption.
Steganography is often used with cryptography.

# Installation


```bash
$ pipenv install Stegano
```

You will be able to use Stegano in your Python programs.

If you only want to install Stegano as a command line tool:

```bash
$ pipx install Stegano
```

pipx installs scripts (system wide available) provided by Python packages into
separate virtualenvs to shield them from your system and each other.


# Usage

A [tutorial](https://stegano.readthedocs.io) is available.


## Use Stegano as a library in your Python program

If you want to use Stegano in your Python program you just have to import the
appropriate steganography technique. For example:

```python
>>> from stegano import lsb
>>> secret = lsb.hide("./tests/sample-files/Lenna.png", "Hello World")
>>> secret.save("./Lenna-secret.png")
>>>
>>> clear_message = lsb.reveal("./Lenna-secret.png")
```


## Use Stegano as a command line tool

### Hide and reveal a message

```bash
$ stegano-lsb hide -i ./tests/sample-files/Lenna.png -m "Secret Message" -o Lena1.png
$ stegano-lsb reveal -i Lena1.png
Secret Message
```


### Hide the message with the Sieve of Eratosthenes

```bash
$ stegano-lsb-set hide -i ./tests/sample-files/Lenna.png -m 'Secret Message' --generator eratosthenes -o Lena2.png
```

The message will be scattered in the picture, following a set described by the
Sieve of Eratosthenes. Other sets are available. You can also use your own
generators.

This will make a steganalysis more complicated.


# Running the tests

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover -v
```

Running the static type checker:

```bash
$ python tools/run_mypy.py
```


# Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute to Stegano I highly
recommend you to install it in a Python virtual environment with pipenv.
