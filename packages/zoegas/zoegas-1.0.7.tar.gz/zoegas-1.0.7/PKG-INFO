Description: # Old Norse Dictionary Zoega
        Zoëga's A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic parser
        
        With the **reader.py** module, you can:
        
        * search a word with an edit distance below a given threshold,
        * extract the POS tags in dictionary entries,
        * search for exact entry and approximate entry.
        
        However POS tag extractor is not very efficient. More special cases need to be handled.
        
        TODO list:
        * [x] look up a word in dictionary
        * [x] search all words in dictionary which are at most at a given edit distance with the query word
        * [ ] handle more dictionary entry,
        * [ ] process all entries so that we would get virtually all the Old Norse words,
        * [ ] for each form, we can associate lemmata with a proposed POS tag.
        
        ## Elaboration of data
        
        Data come from https://github.com/GreekFellows/lesser-dannatt and http://norroen.info/dct/zoega by Tim Ermolaev.
        Then `utils.first_step()` is launched. I modified the files in order to ensure 
        XML syntax consistency, finally `utils.second_step()` is launched.
