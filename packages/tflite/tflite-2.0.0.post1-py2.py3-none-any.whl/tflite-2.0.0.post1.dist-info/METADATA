The python package to parse TFLite models
=========================================

TFLite models (`*.tflite`) are in [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) format. This `tflite` package is built to parse the TFLite models from the `schema.fbs` of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).


## Usage

Using this package, you can parse the TFLite models (`*.tflite`) in Python. One target of this package is to let people use it as the one originally built from `schema.fbs`.

### Installation

This package can be installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/tflite/), and is versioning *similar* to [TensorFlow package](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/). And the version mapping is as below.

| TensorFlow package version   | tflite package version |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
|      1.14.0                  |      1.14.0.post1      |
|      1.15.0                  |      1.15.0.post1      |
|      2.0.0                   |      2.0.0.post1       |

It would be better if you use a correct version, such as:

```sh
pip install tensorflow==1.14.0
pip install tflite==1.14.0.post1
```

### Easy Import

Basically, you can use this package just like the newly FlatBuffers generated one ([example](tests/test_original_import.py)):

```python
from tflite.Model import Model
# use Model
```

In addition, you may use the **Easy Import** (recommanded) to avoid too many imports per submodules ([example](tests/test_easy_import.py)). The *easy import* imports the classes and functions of one submodules into top module directly, e.g. import the `{package}.{submodules}.{class or function}` as `{package}.{class or function}`. For example, when building the `Model` object, `tflite.Model.GetRootAsModel(buf, 0)`.

```python
import tflite
# use tflite.Model
```


## Development

> Package users can safely ignore this part.

To develop this package, additional depdendency can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The [`tools`](tools) directory holds some scripts to update the package to corresponding TensorFlow version. There are three steps currently:
1. [Download](tools/update-schema.sh) the `schema.fbs` change of a version.
2. [Update](tools/update-importing.py) the classes and functions import of submodules.
3. Update the versioning in [setup.py](setup.py).
4. [Build](tools/build.sh) and [Test](tests) around.
5. [Upload](tools/upload.sh) the package to PyPI.

Features could be added to make the parsing easy in the future.

Don't forget to re-install the newly built `tflite` package before testing it. You may also try `source tools/source-me.sh` rather than the annoying build and install process in development.
