"""
ae package core constants, helper functions and base classes
============================================================

This module declares practical constants, base classes as well as tiny helper functions
making the code of your application (and other modules of this package) much cleaner.

Constants
---------

For to set the debug level of your application run-time you can use one of the constants
:data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_DISABLED`, :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_ENABLED`, :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_VERBOSE`
or :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_TIMESTAMPED`. The debug level of your application can be either
hard-coded in your code or optionally also externally (using the :ref:`config-files`
or :ref:`config-options` of the module :mod:`ae.console`).

Short names for all debug level constants are provided by the dict :data:`DEBUG_LEVELS`.

For to use the :mod:`python logging module <logging>` in conjunction with this module
the constant :data:`LOGGING_LEVELS` is providing a mapping between the debug levels
and the python logging levels.

Standard ISO format strings for date and datetime values are provided by the constants
:data:`DATE_ISO` and :data:`DATE_TIME_ISO`.

The encoding of strings into byte-strings (for to output them to the console/stdout or
to file contents) can be tricky sometimes. For to not lose any logging output because
of invalid characters this module will automatically handle any :exc:`UnicodeEncodeError`
exception for you. Invalid characters will in case of this error be converted
to the default encoding (specified by :data:`DEF_ENCODING`) with the default error
handling method specified by :data:`DEF_ENCODE_ERRORS`.


Helper Functions
----------------

Although most of the helper functions provided by this module are tiny with only few lines
of code, they are a great help in making your application code more clear and readable.

For the dynamic execution of functions and code blocks the helper functions :func:`try_call`,
:func:`try_exec` and :func:`exec_with_return` are provided. And :func:`try_eval` is making
the evaluation of dynamic python expressions much easier. These functions are e.g. used
by the :class:`~ae.literal.Literal` class for the implementation of dynamically
determined literal values.

The functions :func:`module_name`, :func:`stack_frames` and :func:`stack_variable` are very
helpful for to inspect the call stack. With them you can easily access the stack frame
and read e.g. variable values of the callers of your functions/methods. The class
:class:`AppBase` is using them e.g. for to determine the
:attr:`version <AppBase.app_version>` and :attr:`title <AppBase.app_title>` of your application.

Other helper functions for the inspection and debugging of your application are
:func:`full_stack_trace`, :func:`sys_env_dict` and :func:`sys_env_text`.

The :func:`parse_date` helper function is converting date and datetime string literals into the
built-in types :class:`datetime.datetime` and :class:`datetime.date`.

Two of the bigger helper functions are :func:`correct_email` and :func:`correct_phone`,
which are useful for to check if a string contains a valid email address or phone number. They
also allow you to automatically correct an email address or a phone number to a valid format.
More sophisticated helpers for the validation of email addresses, phone numbers and
post addresses are available in the :mod:`ae.validation` module.

For to encode unicode strings to other codecs the functions :func:`force_encoding` and
:func:`to_ascii` can be used. The :func:`print_out` function, which is fully compatible to pythons
:func:`print`, is using these encode helpers for to auto-correct invalid characters.

:func:`hide_dup_line_prefix` is very practical if you want to remove or hide redundant
line prefixes in your log files, to make them better readable.

Finally the :func:`round_traditional` get declared in this module fully compatible to
Python's :func:`round` function, to be used for traditional rounding of float values.


Application Base Classes
------------------------

The classes :class:`AppBase` and :class:`SubApp` are applying logging and debugging features
to your application. Create in your application one instance of :class:`AppBase` for to represent
the main application task. If your application needs a separate logging/debugging configuration for
sub-threads or sub-tasks then create an :class:`SubApp` instance for each of these sub-apps.

Sub-apps are not tied to any fix use-case. They can be created for example for each sub-task or
application thread. You could also create a :class:`SubApp` instance for each of your external systems,
like a database server or for to connect your application onto different test environments
or to your live an your production system (e.g. for system comparison and maintenance).

Both application classes are automatically catching and handling any exceptions and run-time
errors: only if any critical exception/error cannot be handled then the :meth:`~AppBase.shutdown`
method will make sure that all sub-apps and threads get terminated and joined.
Additionally all print-out buffers will be flushed for to include all the info
of the critical error (the last debug and error messages) into the
standard error/output and into any activated log files.


Basic Usage
...........

At the top of your python application main file/module create an instance of the class :class:`AppBase`::

    '' '' '' docstring of your application main module '' '' ''
    from console import AppBase

    __version__ = '1.2.3'

    ca = AppBase()

In the above example the :class:`AppBase` instance will automatically use the docstring of your application
main module as application title and the string in the module variable __version___ as application version.
Alternatively you can specify your application title and version string by passing them as the first two
arguments (:paramref:`~AppBase.app_title` and :paramref:`~AppBase.app_version`)
to the instantiation call of :class:`AppBase`.

:class:`AppBase` also determines automatically the name/id of your application from the file base name
of your application main/startup module (e.g. <app_name>.py or main.py). Also other application environment
vars/options (like e.g. the application startup folder path and the current working directory path) will be
automatically initialized for your application.


Application Class Hierarchy
...........................

For most use cases you will never need to instantiate from :class:`AppBase` directly - instead you will
instantiate one of the classes that are inherited from this base class.

The class :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` e.g. inherits from :class:`AppBase` and is adding
configuration options and variables to it. So in your console application it is recommended to directly
use instances of :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` instead of :class:`AppBase`.

For applications with an GUI use instead one of the classes :class:`~ae.kivy_app.KivyApp`,
:class:`~ae.enaml_app.EnamlApp` or :class:`~ae.dabo_app.DaboApp`. These app GUI classes
inherit all functionality from :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` and :class:`AppBase`.


Application Logging
-------------------

Print-outs are an essential tool for the debugging and logging of your application at run-time. In python
the print-outs are done with the :func:`print` function or the python :mod:`logging` module. These
print-outs get per default send to the standard output and error streams of your OS and so displayed on
your system console/shell. The :func:`print_out` function and the :meth:`~AppBase.print_out` method of
this :mod:`.core` module are adding two more sophisticated ways for print-outs to the console/log-files.

Using :class:`AppBase` is making the logging much easier and also ensures that print-outs of any
imported library or package will be included within your log files. This is done by redirecting the
standard output and error streams to your log files with the help of the :class:`_PrintingReplicator`
class.

Head-less server applications like web servers are mostly not allowed to use the standard output streams.
For some these applications you could redirect the standard output and error streams to a log file by
using the OS redirection character (>)::

    python your_application.py >log_std_out.log 2>log_std_err.log

But because most web servers doesn't allow you to use this redirection, you can alternatively specify
the :paramref:`~AppBase.suppress_stdout` parameter as True in the instantiation of an :class:`AppBase`
instance. Additionally you can call the :meth:`~AppBase.init_logging` method for to activate a log file.
After that all print-outs of your application and libraries will only appear in your log file.

Also in complex applications, where huge print-outs to the console can get lost easily, you want to use
a log file instead. But even a single log file can get messy to read, especially for multi-threaded
server applications. For that :class:`SubApp` is allowing you to create for each thread a separate
sub-app instance with its own log file.


Enable Ae Log File
..................

.. _ae-log-file:

Ae Log Files are text files using by default the encoding of your OS console/shell. To activate the
redirection of your applications print-outs into a ae log file for a :class:`AppBase` instance you
simply specify the file name of the log file in the :meth:`~AppBase.init_logging` method call::

    app = AppBase()
    app.init_logging(log_file_name='my_log_file.log')


Enable Ae Logging Features
..........................

For multi-threaded applications you can include the thread-id of the printing thread automatically
into your log files. For that you have to pass a True value to the
:paramref:`~AppBase.multi_threading` argument. For to additionally also suppress any print-outs
to the standard output/error streams pass True to the :paramref:`~AppBase.suppress_stdout` argument::

    app = AppBase(multi_threading=True, suppress_stdout=True)
    app.init_logging(log_file_name='my_log_file.log')

The ae log files provided by this module are automatically rotating if the size of an log file
succeeds the value in MBytes defined in the :data:`LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE`. For to adapt this value
to your needs you can specify the maximum log file size in MBytes with the argument
:paramref:`~AppBase.init_logging.log_file_size_max` in your call of :meth:`~AppBase.init_logging`::

    app.init_logging(log_file_name='my_log_file.log', log_file_size_max=9.)

By using the :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` class instead of :class:`AppBase` you can
alternatively store the logging configuration of your application within a
:ref:`configuration variable <config-variables>` or a
:ref:`configuration option <config-options>`.
The order of precedence for to find the appropriate logging configuration of each
app instance is documented :meth:`here <ae.console.ConsoleApp._init_logging>` .


Using Python Logging Module
...........................

If you prefer to use instead the python logging module for the print-outs of your application,
then pass a :mod:`python logging configuration dictionary <logging.config>` with the individual
configuration of your logging handlers, files and loggers to the
:paramref:`~AppBase.init_logging.py_logging_params` argument of the
:meth:`~AppBase.init_logging` method::

    app.init_logging(py_logging_params=my_py_logging_config_dict)

Passing the python logging configuration dictionary to one of the :class:`AppBase`
instances created by your application will automatically disable the ae log file of this
instance.


Application Debugging
---------------------

For to use the debug features of :mod:`~ae.core` you simple have to import the needed
:ref:`debug level constant <debug-level-constants>` for to pass it at instantiation of
your :class:`AppBase` or :class:`SubApp` class to the :paramref:`~AppBase.debug_level` argument:

    app = AppBase(..., debug_level=DEBUG_LEVEL_ENABLED)     # same for :class:`SubApp`

By passing :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_ENABLED` the print-outs (and log file contents) will be more detailed,
and even more verbose if you use instead the debug level :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_VERBOSE`.
The highest verbosity you get with debug level :data:`DEBUG_LEVEL_TIMESTAMPED`,
which is also adding the actual date and time to the print-outs and logs.

The debug level can be changed at any time in your application code by directly assigning
the new debug level to the :attr:`~AppBase.debug_level` attribute. If you prefer to change
the (here hard-coded) debug levels dynamically, then use the :class:`ConsoleApp` instead
of :class:`AppBase`, because :class:`ConsoleApp` provides the `debugLevel`
:ref:`configuration file variable <config-variables>`
and :ref:`commend line option <config-options>` for
to specify :ref:`the actual debug level <pre-defined-config-options>` without the need
to change (and re-build) your application code.
