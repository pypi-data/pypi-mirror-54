"pyvar" is a Python package to run variational inverions 
with the models LMDz or CHIMERE

To make your working copy known to your python session, you
can install a local development version using:

$ python setup.py develop --user

which will "compile" the code locally but creates a link in
your local library folder. The link can be removed with:

$ python setup.py develop --user -u
