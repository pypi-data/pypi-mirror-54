"""
This is the message bus for the Dataset Catalog service. It is politely borrowed almost whole cloth from the book
linked below. There are currently no events or commands hooked up to this bus, so it doesn't do anything at the
moment. However, this is expected to change in the near future, so it has been setup ahead of that point in time.
