    "# How to create an LGST-only report\n",
    "This example shows how you can create a HTML report from just the results of running *linear GST* (LGST).  This can be useful when you want to get a rough estimate of your gates quickly, as LGST is takes substantially less data and computation time compared with long-sequence GST.  This example is modeled after Tutorial 0."
