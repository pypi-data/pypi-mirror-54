    "### Step 4: Run GST using `do_long_sequence_gst`\n",
    "Just like for 1-qubit GST, we call the driver routine `do_long_sequence_gst` to compute the GST estimates.  Usually for two qubits this could take a long time (hours on a single cpu) based on the number of operation sequences used, and running on multiple processors is a good idea (see the MPI example).  However, since we chose an incomplete set of only 4 germs and set our maximum max-length to 2, this will run fairly quickly (~10min).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes about the options/arguments to `do_long_sequence_gst` that are particularly relevant to 2-qubit GST:\n",
    "  - `memoryLimit` gives an estimate of how much memory is available to use on your system (in bytes).  This is currently *not* a hard limit, and pyGSTi may require slightly more memory than this \"limit\".  So you'll need to be conservative in the value you place here: if your machine has 10GB of RAM, set this to 6 or 8 GB initially and increase it as you see how much memory is actually used using a separate OS performance monitor tool.  If you're running on multiple processors, this should be the memory available *per processor*.\n",
    "  - `verbosity` tells the routine how much detail to print to stdout.  If you don't mind waiting a while without getting any output, you can leave this at its default value (2).  If you can't standing wondering whether GST is still running or has locked up, set this to 3.\n",
    "  - `advancedOptions` is a dictionary that accepts various \"advanced\" settings that aren't typically needed.  While we don't require its use below, the `depolarizeStart` key of this dictionary may be useful in certain cases: it gives an amount (in [0,1]) to depolarize the (LGST) estimate that is used as the initial guess for long-sequence GST.  In practice, we find that, sometime, in the larger 2-qubit Hilbert space, the LGST estimate may be so poor as to adversely affect the subsequent long-sequence GST (e.g. very slow convergence).  Depolarizing the LGST estimate can remedy this.  If you're unsure what to put here, either don't specify `depolarizeLGST` at all (the same as using 0.0), or just use 0.1, i.e. `advancedOptions={ 'depolarizeStart' : 0.1 }`."
