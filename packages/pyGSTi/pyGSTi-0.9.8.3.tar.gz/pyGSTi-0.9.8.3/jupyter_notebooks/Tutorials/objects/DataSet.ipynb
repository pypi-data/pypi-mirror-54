    "# Data Sets Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to create and use `DataSet` objects.  PyGSTi uses `DataSet` objects to hold experimental or simulated data in the form of outcome counts.  When a `DataSet` is used to hold time-independent data (the typical case, and all we'll look at in this tutorial), it essentially looks like a nested dictionary which associates operation sequences with dictionaries of (outcome-label,count) pairs so that `dataset[circuit][outcomeLabel]` can be used to read & write the number of `outcomeLabel` outcomes of the experiment given by the circuit `circuit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important differences between a `DataSet` and a dictionary-of-dictionaries:\n",
    "- `DataSet` objects can be in one of two modes: *static* or *non-static*.  When in *non-static* mode, data can be freely modified within the set, making this mode to use during the data-entry.  In the *static* mode, data cannot be modified and the `DataSet` is essentially read-only.  The `done_adding_data` method of a `DataSet` switches from non-static to static mode, and should be called, as the name implies, once all desired data has been added (or modified).  Once a `DataSet` is static, it is read-only for the rest of its life; to modify its data the best one can do is make a non-static *copy* via the `copy_nonstatic` member and modify the copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because `DataSet`s may contain time-dependent data, the dictionary-access syntax for a single outcome label (i.e. `dataset[circuit][outcomeLabel]`) *cannot* be used to write counts for new `circuit` keys; One should instead  use the `add_`*xxx* methods of the `DataSet` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a `DataSet` is constructed, filled with data, and made *static*, it is typically passed as a parameter to one of pyGSTi's algorithm or driver routines to find a `Model` estimate based on the data.  This tutorial focuses on how to construct a `DataSet` and modify its data.  Later tutorials will demonstrate the different GST algorithms."

    "## Creating a `DataSet`\n",
    "There three basic ways to create `DataSet` objects in `pygsti`:\n",
    "* By creating an empty `DataSet` object and manually adding counts corresponding to operation sequences.  Remember that the `add_`*xxx* methods must be used to add data for operation sequences not yet in the `DataSet`.  Once the data is added, be sure to call `done_adding_data`, as this restructures the internal storage of the `DataSet` to optimize the access operations used by algorithms.\n",
    "* By loading from a text-format dataset file via `pygsti.io.load_dataset`.  The result is a ready-to-use-in-algorithms *static* `DataSet`, so there's no need to call `done_adding_data` this time.\n",
    "* By using a `Model` to generate \"fake\" data via `generate_fake_data`. This can be useful for doing simulations of GST, and comparing to your experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do each of these in turn in the cells below."

This is because outcome labels in pyGSTi are tuples of time-ordered instrument element (see the [intermediate measurements tutorial](advanced/Instruments.ipynb)) and POVM effect labels.  In the special but common case when there are no intermediate measurements, the outcome label is a 1-tuple of just the final POVM effect label.  In this case, one may use the effect label itself (e.g. `'0'` or `'1'`) in place of the 1-tuple in almost all contexts, as it is automatically converted to the 1-tuple (e.g. `('0',)` or `('1',)`) internally.  When printing, however, the 1-tuple is still displayed to remind the user of the more general structure contained in the `DataSet`."

    "When creating a `DataSet` one may specify the `collisionAction` argument as either `\"aggregate\"` (the default) or `\"keepseparate\"`.  The former instructs the `DataSet` to simply add the counts of like outcomes when counts are added for an already existing gate sequence.  `\"keepseparate\"`, on the other hand, causes the `DataSet` to tag added count data by appending a fictitious `\"#<n>\"` operation label to a gate sequence that already exists, where `<n>` is an integer.  When retreiving the keys of a `keepseparate` data set, the `stripOccuranceTags` argument to `keys()` determines whether the `\"#<n>\"` labels are included in the output (if they're not - the default - duplicate keys may be returned).  Access to different occurances of the same data are provided via the `occurrance` argument of the `get_row` and `set_row` functions, which should be used instead of the usual bracket indexing."
