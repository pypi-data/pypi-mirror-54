    "The `pygsti` package provides multiple levels of abstraction over the core Gate Set Tomography (GST) algorithms.  This  tutorial will show you how to work with pyGSTi's top-level functions for performing GST with a minimial amount of effort.  In order to run the GST protocol there are 3 essential ingredients: 1) data specifing the experimental outcomes, 2) a desired, or \"target\", `Model`, and 3) lists of `Circuit` objects, specifying the operation sequences to use at each successive step in the GST optimization.  The [GST overview tutorial](GST-Overview.ipynb), gave an end-to-end example of how to construct GST circuits, run GST, and generate a report.  This tutorial focus on the second step in more detail; more information about circuit construction and report generation can be found in the [GST circuits tutorial](../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb) and [report generation tutorial](../reporting/ReportGeneration.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different \"driver routines\" for running GST, and we'll cover in turn:\n",
    "- [`do_long_sequence_gst`](#do_long_sequence_gst) - runs a single instance of GST with \"standard\" circuit lists.\n",
    "- [`do_long_sequence_gst_base`](#do_long_sequence_gst_base) - runs a single instance of GST with custom circuit lists.\n",
    "- [`do_stdpractice_gst`](#do_stdpractice_gst) - runs a multiple instances of GST with \"standard\" circuits based on an `ExplicitOpModel` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function returns a single `pygsti.objects.Results` object (see the [Result object tutorial](../objects/advanced/Results.ipynb), which contains the *single* input `DataSet` and one or more *estimates* (`pygsti.objects.Estimate` objects). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The abbreviation **LSGST** (lowercase in function names to follow Python naming conventions) stands for *Long Sequence LinearOperator Set Tomography*, and refers to the more powerful and flexible of GST that utilizes long sequences to find model estimates.  LSGST can be compared to *Linear GST*, or **LGST**, which only uses short sequences and as a result provides much less accurate estimates."

    "The above example supplies the minimal amount of information required to run the long-sequence GST algorithm.  `do_long_sequence_gst` can be used in a variety of contexts and accepts additional (optional) arguments that affect the way the algorithm is run.  Here we make several remarks regarding alternate or more advanced usage of `do_long_sequence_gst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For many of the arguments, you can supply either a filename or a python object (e.g. dataset, target model, operation sequence lists), so if you find yourself loading things from files just to pass them in as arguments, you're probabaly working too hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically we want to apply certain constraints to a GST optimization.  As mentioned in the model tutorial, the space over which a gate-set estimation is carried out is dictated by the parameterization of the `targetModel` argument.  For example, to constrain a GST estimate to be trace-preserving, one should call `set_all_parameterizations(\"TP\")` on the target `Model` before calling `do_long_sequence_gst`.  See the [tutorial on explicit models](../objects/ExplicitModel.ipynb) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `gaugeOptParams` argument specifies a dictionary of parameters ultimately to be passed to the `gaugeopt_to_target` function (which provides full documentation).  By specifying an `itemWeights` argument we can set the ratio of the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) weighting to the gate weighting when performing a gauge optimization.  In the example below, the gate parameters are weighted 1000 times more relative to the SPAM parameters.  Mathematically this corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 0.001 preceding the sum-of-squared-difference terms corresponding to SPAM elements in the model.   Typically it is good to weight the gates parameters more heavily since GST amplifies gate parameter errors via long operation sequences but cannot amplify SPAM parameter errors.  If unsure, 0.001 is a good value to start with.  For more details on the arguments of `gaugeopt_to_target`, see the previous tutorial on low-level algorithms.  For more infomation, see the [gauge optimization tutorial](advanced/GaugeOpt.ipynb).\n",

This function provides a clean and simple interface to performing a \"usual\" set of GST analyses on a set of data.  As such, it takes a single `DataSet`, similar gate-sequence-specifying parameters to `do_long_sequence_gst`, and a new `modes` argument which is a comma-separated list of \"canned\" GST analysis types (e.g. `\"TP,CPTP\"` will compute a Trace-Preserving estimate *and* a Completely-Positive & Trace-Preserving estimate). The currently available modes are:\n",

The `gaugeOptTarget` argument may be set to a `Model` that is used as the target for gauge optimization, overriding the (typically ideal) target gates given by the `targetModelFilenameOrObj` argument."

    "Finally, we'll demonstrate how to specify a fully custom set of gauge optimization parameters and how to use a **separately-specified target model for gauge optimization**.  You can get a more intuitive gauge-optimized `Model` when by placing as much expected noise as possible into the gauge-optimization target, as this essentially tells the algorithm \"this is what I think the estimated model should look like\".  If you just use the perfect or ideal model for this (the default), then the gauge optimizer may make tradeoffs which don't reflect the expected physics (remember, all gauge-equivalent models product the same observables!).  For example, it may spread error across all your gate operations when you expect just the 2-qubit operations are noisy."
