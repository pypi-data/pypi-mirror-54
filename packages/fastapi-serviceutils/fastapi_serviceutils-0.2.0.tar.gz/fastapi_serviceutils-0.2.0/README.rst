Development
-----------

Initialize project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After cloning the repository, you can initialize your development environment using

.. code-block:: bash

       make init

This will create the dev environment exampleservice/dev. Activate it using:

.. code-block:: bash

       dephell venv shell --env devs

Start development
-----------------

**Note:**

Make sure to always activate the environment when you start working on the
project in a new terminal using

.. code-block:: bash

       dephell venv shell --env devs

Updating dependencies
---------------------

After each change in dependencies defined at ``pyproject.toml`` run the
following to ensure the environment-definition and lock-file are up to date:

.. code-block:: bash

       make update

Checking with linters and checkers
----------------------------------

To run all pre-commit-hooks manually run:

.. code-block:: bash

Info about project-state

Documentation
-------------

The project's developer documentation is written using Sphinx.

The documentation sources can be found in the docs subdirectory.
They are written using restructuredText.

The API-documentation is auto-generated from the docstrings of modules,
classes, and functions.
We're using the Google docstring standard.

To generate the documentation, run

.. code-block:: bash

       make docs

The generated HTML files will be in the ``docs/_build`` directory.

There is also a swagger-documentation to be used for users of the service.

The apidoc can be found at ``/apidoc/index.html``.

Tests
-----

For testing we use ``pytest``\ , for details see
`Pytest Docs <http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_.
