Description: # Selective (Swift) Linter
        
        This is a package to be used as a pre-commit git hook to lint changes in .swift files using [Swiftlint Installed via Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/swiftlint).
        
        ### Installation and  Dependencies
        
        To install swiftlint from the terminal use Homebrew:
        ```sh
        $ brew install swiftlint
        ```
        To install this Python3 package
        
        ```sh
        $ pip3 install selective_linter
        ```
        
        To install the git hook to a repository, navigate to the root of that repository and run
        
        ```sh
        $ selective_linter -i
        ```
        
        This also adds the `.lint_cache` file to your `.gitignore`. 
        
        To deactivate the script run
        
        ```sh
        $ git config hooks.skipswiftlint true
        ```
