        Many people would like to have external web pages inside your Plone site.
        windowZ was born to do it, in an elegant way.
        
        windowZ provides a new content type, named Window, that is similar to the
        content type Link. It shows the provided relative or absolute URL inside an
        iFrame rendered as a Plone page.
        
        However we can configure windowZ to do some usefull things to us, like:
        
        * Displays inside Plone any outside-to-Plone web page available on the web.
        * Catalogs the content from the provided web pages. Users may choose which
          pages to catalog.
        * Gives users the ability to hide left, right or both columns of the Plone
          site.
        * Each page may be individually resized.
        * Users may opt display the content metadata or show only the web page
          without any meta-information in the Plone.
        
        windowZ was the CMFDisplayPage product available only in the Plone collective
        repository without any release. But it was too hard to mantain and evolute it
        because its code was pure CMF-aware.
        
        So it was rewrited from scratch using ArchGenXML to generate the code. Just
        in a few hours of work. Now we can finally make a release! ArchGenXML rocks!
        
        It's pronunciation may be: windows, windoze, window(Z) of Zope... You are free
        to choose the way... ;-)
        
        Please, help us to improve and translate windowZ!
        
        **Please note: version 2.x only work on Plone 5.0.x and higher, for Plone 4 use 1.x.**

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0.1 (2019-10-30)
        ==================
        
        - Update pt_BR translation
          [ramiroluz]
        
        
        2.0 (2017-11-07)
        ================
        
        - Ported to Plone 5: removed WindowZTool and replaced it with registry.
          [tlotze]
        
        - Removed ``show_window`` feature which was apparently unused and didn't work
          as advertised.
          [tlotze]
        
        - Fixed dependencies to ATCT/AT in profiles and test setup
          [MrTango]
        
        
        1.5 (2013-10-28)
        ================
        
        - Fixed ``AttributeError: portal_windowZ`` in show_window template,
          even though this template seems unused.  Note that in version 1.3b3
          the id ``portal_windowZ` was renamed to ``portal_windowz`, with a
          lowercase ``z``.  If you get this AttributeError when viewing
          windowz (also with other templates than show_window) then you have
          probably upgraded from an old version and the tool on your website
          still has the old ``portal_windowZ`` id.  In that case you should
          deactivate the windowZ product in the Add-ons control panel and
          activate it again.
