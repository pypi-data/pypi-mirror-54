.. _GatingProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A GatingProjection is a type of `ModulatoryProjection <ModulatoryProjection>` that projects to the `InputPort` or
`OutputPort` of a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`. It takes the value of a `GatingSignal` of a `GatingMechanism`,
and uses it to modulate the `value <Port_Base.value>` of the Port to which it projects.

.. _GatingProjection_Creation:

Creating a GatingProjection
----------------------------

A GatingProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in the specification of an `InputPort <InputPort_Projection_Source_Specification>` or `OutputPort
<OutputPort_Projections>` .  If a GatingProjection is created explicitly (using its constructor), its **receiver**
argument can be specified as a particular InputPort or OutputPort of a designated `Mechanism <Mechanism>`, or simply
as the Mechanism.  In the latter case, the Mechanism's `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>` will be used. If the
GatingProjection is included in an InputPort or OutputPort specification, that Port will be assigned as the
GatingProjection's `receiver <GatingProjection.receiver>`. If the **sender** and/or **receiver** arguments are not
specified, its initialization is `deferred <GatingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.


.. _GatingProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

*Deferred Initialization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a GatingProjection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <ControlProjection.sender>` and `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows
a GatingProjection to be created before its `sender` and/or `receiver` have been created (e.g., before them in a
script), by calling its constructor without specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the
GatingProjection to be operational, initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init` method.  This is
not necessary if the Port(s) to be gated are specified in the **gate** argument of a `GatingMechanism
<GatingMechanism_Specifying_Gating>`, in which case deferred initialization is completed automatically by the
GatingMechanism when it is created.

.. _GatingProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

The `sender <GatingProjection.sender>` of a GatingProjection is a `GatingSignal` of a `GatingMechanism`.  The `value
<GatingSignal.value>` of the `sender <GatingProjection.sender>` is used by the GatingProjection as its
`variable <GatingProjection.variable>`;  this is also assigned to its `gating_signal
<GatingProjection.gating_signal>` attribute, and serves as the input to the GatingProjection's `function
<GatingProjection.function>`.  The default `function <GatingProjection.function>` for a
GatingProjection is an identity function (`Linear` with **slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0);  that is,
it simply conveys the value of its `gating_signal <GatingProjection.gating_signal>` to its `receiver
<GatingProjection.receiver>`, for use in modifying the `value <Port_Base.value>` of the Port that it gates. Its
`receiver <GatingProjection.receiver>` is the `InputPort` or `OutputPort` of a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`.

.. _GatingProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A GatingProjection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `InputPort` or `OutputPort` to which it
projects is updated.  Note that this only occurs when the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` to which the `Port <Port>`
belongs is executed (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating). When a GatingProjection
is executed, its `function <GatingProjection.function>` gets the `gating_signal <GatingProjection.gating_signal>` from
its `sender <GatingProjection.sender>` and conveys that to its `receiver <GatingProjection.receiver>`.  This is used by
the `receiver <GatingProjection.receiver>` to modify the `value <Port_Base.value>` of the Port gated by the
GatingProjection (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation`, `InputPort Execution <InputPort_Execution>` and `OutputPort
Execution <OutputPort_Execution>` for how modulation operates and how this applies to a InputPorts and OutputPorts).

.. note::
   The changes in an InputPort or OutputPort's `value <Port_Base.value >` in response to the execution of a
   GatingProjection are not applied until the Mechanism to which the Port belongs is next executed;
   see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            The GatingProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a projection to the InputPort or OutputPort of a Mechanism that modulates the value of
            that port
            It:
               - takes a scalar as its input (sometimes referred to as a "gating signal")
               - uses its `function` to compute its value
               - its value is used to modulate the value of the port to which it projects

        ** MOVE:
        ProjectionRegistry:
            All GatingProjections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

        `deferred <GatingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    receiver : Optional[Mechanism, InputPort or OutputPort]
        specifies the `InputPort` or `OutputPort` to which the GatingProjection projects; if it is not specified,
        and cannot be `inferred from context <GatingProjection_Creation>`, initialization is `deferred
        <GatingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        specifies the function used to convert the `gating_signal <GatingProjection.gating_signal>` to the

       before combining it with others (see `weight <GatingProjection.weight>` for additional details).

    exponent : number : default None
       specifies the value by which to exponentiate the GatingProjection's `value <GatingProjection.value>`
       before combining it with others (see `exponent <GatingProjection.exponent>` for additional details).

        GatingProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` (see `GatingSignal_Structure` for a description
        of GatingSignal parameters).

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterPort_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the GatingProjection, its `function <GatingProjection.function>`, and/or a custom function and its parameters.
        Values specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the

        specifies the name of the GatingProjection.
