.. _ControlProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A ControlProjection is a type of `ModulatoryProjection <ModulatoryProjection>` that projects to the `ParameterPort
<ParameterPort>` of a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>`. It takes the `value <ControlSignal.value>` of a
`ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` and uses it to  modify the value of the parameter associated
with the ParameterPort to which it projects.  All of the ControlProjections in a Composition, along with its other
`control components <ControlMechanism>`, can be displayed using the Composition's `show_graph <Composition.show_graph>`
method with its **show_control** argument assigned as `True`.

.. _ControlProjection_Creation:

Creating a ControlProjection
----------------------------

A ControlProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a Projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in a `tuple <ParameterPort_Tuple_Specification>` that specifies a parameter for a `Mechanism
<Mechanism>`, `MappingProjection`, or the `function <Component.function>` of either of these.  If a ControlProjection
is created explicitly (using its constructor), and either its **receiver** or **sender** argument is not specified,
its initialization is `deferred <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.  If it is included in a `parameter
specification <ParameterPort_Specification>`, the  `ParameterPort` for the parameter being specified will be assigned
as the ControlProjection's `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.
COMMENT:
TBI FOR COMPOSITION
If the **receiver** belongs to a Mechanism that is part of a `System`, then the ControlProjection's
`sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is assigned to a `ControlSignal` of the System's `controller`.  Otherwise,
its initialization is `deferred <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.
COMMENT

.. _ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

*Deferred Initialization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a ControlProjection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its `sender
<ControlProjection.sender>` and `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows
a ControlProjection to be created before its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` and/or `receiver
<ControlProjection.receiver>` have been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor without
specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the ControlProjection to be operational,
initialization must be completed by a call to its `deferred_init` method. This is done automatically if the
ControlProjection is included in a `tuple specification <ParameterPort_Tuple_Specification>` for the parameter of a
`Mechanism <Mechanism>` or its `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`, when the `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`
is created for the `Composition` to which the parameter's owner belongs (see `ControlMechanism_Creation`).


.. _ControlProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

The `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` of a ControlProjection is a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism
<ControlMechanism>`. The `value <ControlSignal.value>` of the `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is used by the
ControlProjection as its `variable <ControlProjection.variable>`;  this is also assigned to its `control_signal
<ControlProjection.control_signal>` attribute, and serves as the input to the ControlProjection's `function
<ControlProjection.function>`.  The default `function <ControlProjection.function>` for a
ControlProjection is an identity function (`Linear` with **slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0);  that is, it simply
conveys the value of its `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>` to its `receiver
<ControlProjection.receiver>`, for use in modifying the value of the parameter that it controls. Its `receiver
<ControlProjection.receiver>` is the `ParameterPort` for the parameter of the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` or its `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>` that is controlled by the ControlProjection.

.. _ControlProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlProjection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `ParameterPort` to which it projects is
updated.  Note that this only occurs when the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` to which the `ParameterPort` belongs is executed
(see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating). When a ControlProjection is executed, its
`function <ControlProjection.function>` gets the `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>` from its `sender
<ControlProjection.sender>` and conveys that to its `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.  This is used by the
`receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` to modify the parameter controlled by the ControlProjection (see
`ModulatorySignal_Modulation` and `ParameterPort Execution <ParameterPort_Execution>` for how modulation operates and
how this applies to a ParameterPort).

.. note::
   The changes to a parameter in response to the execution of a ControlProjection are not applied until the `Mechanism
   <Mechanism>` that receives the ControlProjection are next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of
   "lazy" updating).

        Description:
            The ControlProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a projection to the ParameterPort of a Mechanism that modifies a parameter of its function.
            It:
               - takes a scalar as its input (sometimes referred to as an "allocation")
               - uses its `function` to compute its value (sometimes referred to as its "intensity"
                 based on its input (allocation) its `sender`,
               - used to modify a parameter of the owner of the `receiver` or its `function`.

        ** MOVE:
        ProjectionRegistry:
            All ControlProjections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

        `deferred <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    receiver : Optional[Mechanism or ParameterPort]
        specifies the `ParameterPort` associated with the parameter to be controlled; if it is not specified,
        and cannot be `inferred from context <ControlProjection_Creation>`, initialization is `deferred
        <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        specifies the function used to convert the `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>` to the

    weight : number : default None
       specifies the value by which to multiply the ControlProjection's `value <ControlProjection.value>`
       before combining it with others (see `weight <ControlProjection.weight>` for additional details).

    exponent : number : default None
       specifies the value by which to exponentiate the ControlProjection's `value <ControlProjection.value>`
       before combining it with others (see `exponent <ControlProjection.exponent>` for additional details).

    control_signal_params pip install --updgrade Sphinx==1.6.2 sphinx-rtd-theme==0.2.4 sphinxcontrib-websupport==1.0.1: Dict[param keyword: param value]

        of ControlSignal parameters).

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterPort_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the ControlProjection, its `function <ControlProjection.function>`, and/or a custom function and its parameters.
