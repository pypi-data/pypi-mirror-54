Description: # Appveyor To Dist Downloader
        
        [![Latest PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/appveyordist.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/appveyordist)
        
        `appveyor-dist` is a script that pulls a project's artifacts
        to your local machine, normally into your `dist` directory.
        
        [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) is a continuous integration service that allows 
        Open Source projects to build releases on their system, but
        to push the resulting packages onto PyPI requires a lot of 
        configuration. This script lets you keep control of pushing
        to PyPI while automatically pulling the files off Appveyor.
        
        Previously I was using [appveyor-artifacts](https://github.com/Robpol86/appveyor-artifacts) for this, but
        its focus is pretty much on downloading coverage files and
        trying to merge them, while I really just want to use the
        artifacts as-is for redistribution. I didn't wind up basing
        the code off their code, as it was rather over-kill for me.
        
        ### Why the weird spelling of artefact?
        
        That's apparently how Americans spell it, and I figure
        we'll follow Appveyor's API in the spelling even if
        it looks weird to Canadians and Brits.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install appveyordist
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        $ cd pyopengl
        $ appveyor-dist --user MikeCFletcher --project pyopengl --dist ./dist
        $ twine upload dist/PyOpenGL_accelerate-3.1.3-*.whl
        ```
        You can pass the `-f` flag to force overwriting files in `dist`,
        by default only new files will be downloaded.
        
        Note that we do *not* expect you to process the results or read
        them. We will simply crash if there's a failure, but we will 
        log warnings if a job in the build/release has crashed/failed.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        Requires Python 3 and requests module, tests require tox and pytest.
