        ## Usage
        
        To get all the possible fish options, run `fish_palettes()`
        
        To create a colormap, use the `fish` function. Several parameters are available:
        * n_colors: the number of colors you want the colormap to have.
        * option: the fish you want the pallette of (can be either int or string).
        * alpha: the alpha of the entire pallette.
        * direction: the direction of the colormap (either forward (1) or reverse (-1)).
