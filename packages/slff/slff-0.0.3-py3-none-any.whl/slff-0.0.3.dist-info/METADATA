# SLFF

---

Provides a utility suite for SLFF.

Usage:

```python

from slff.scoring import score_team_event
from tbapy import TBA

tba = TBA('my tba key')
scores = score_team_event(2791, '2019nytr')
```

### Currently only supports 2019 scoring.

#### score_team_event

* `tba: tbapy.TBA`: tbapy class that SLFF uses internally; will be removed in future version
* `team_number: int`: team number (not key)
* `event_key: str`: event key to score the team at (Einstein scoring currently unimplemented)
* `score_as_year: Union[int, NoneType] = None`: force SLFF to score the event as if it happened in the given year; a value of `None` will instead score it as the year the event occurred
