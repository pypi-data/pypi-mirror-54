    The 'SSBD' and 'VIRT-SSBD' cpu flags have been added to the list
    of available choices for the ``[libvirt]/cpu_model_extra_flags``
    config option. These are important for proper mitigation of the
    Spectre 3a and 4 CVEs. Note that the use of either of these flags
    require updated packages below nova, including libvirt, qemu
    (specifically >=2.9.0 for virt-ssbd), linux, and system
    firmware. For more information see
