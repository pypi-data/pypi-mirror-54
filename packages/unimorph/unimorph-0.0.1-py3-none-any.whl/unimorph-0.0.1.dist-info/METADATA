The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative 
effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the worldâ€™s 
languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data
in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any 
language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried 
by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms 
of a bundle of morphological features from our schema. The 
specification of the schema is described in Sylak-Glassman (2016).
