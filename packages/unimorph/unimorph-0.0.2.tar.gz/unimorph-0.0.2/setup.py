    The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative 
    effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the worldâ€™s 
    languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data
    in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any 
    language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried 
    by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms 
    of a bundle of morphological features from our schema. The 
    specification of the schema is described in Sylak-Glassman (2016).
