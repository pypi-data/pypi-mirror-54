History
=======

This project started in 2014 to provide a disk storage and archival format for
radio signals for use in projects at MIT Haystack Observatory. The concept was
born out of years of experience in collecting and wrangling RF data and
incorporates many lessons learned over that time. In 2017, the project was
officially released to the community under an open source BSD license.
