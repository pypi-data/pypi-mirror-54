Description: # hid-watchdog
        
        This is a simple service to communicate with cheap USB WatchDog timers that create a USB-HID device:

        Please use with caution as it's not well tested!
        
        ## Install
        
        ### Installation on Ubuntu
        
        Create your VirtualEnv, activate it.
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        You will need to install a library on your operating system to interface with the USB-HID device:
        
        ```
        apt install libhidapi-hidraw0
        ```
        
        Alternatively you may be able to use "libhidapi-libusb0" but I didn't have any success with this.
