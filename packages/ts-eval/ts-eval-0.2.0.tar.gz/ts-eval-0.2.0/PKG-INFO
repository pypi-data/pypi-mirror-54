        ---
        A set of tools to help you analyse time series using Python.
        
        ## 🧩 Current features
        
        * **N-step ahead time series evaluation** – using a Jupyter widget.
        * **Friedman / Nemenyi rank test (posthoc)** – to see which model statistically performs better.
        * **Relative Metrics** – rMSE, rMAE + Forecasted Value analogues.
        * **Prediction Interval Metrics** – MIS, rMIS, FVrMIS
        * **Fixed fourier series generation**  – fixed in time according to pandas index
        * **Naive/Seasonal models for baseline predictions** (with prediction intervals)
        * **Statsmodels n-step evaluation** – helper functions to evaluate n-step ahead forecasts using Statsmodels models or naive/seasonal naive models.
        
        Here's how the Jupyter widget looks like:

        Check out [Demo Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vshulyak/ts-eval/blob/master/examples/basic_usage.ipynb).
        
        ## Installation
        
              pip install ts-eval
        
        
        ## 📋 Release Planning:
        
        * Release 0.3
          * travis: add 3.8 default python when it's available
          * docs: supported metrics & API options
          * Maybe use api like Summary in statsmodels MLEModel class, it has extend methods and warn/info messages
          * pretty legend for lots like here https://studywolf.wordpress.com/2017/11/21/matplotlib-legends-for-mean-and-confidence-interval-plots/
          * Look for TODOs
          * changable colors
          * turn off colored display option
          * a nicer API for raw metrics container
          * codacy badge
          * coverage badge
          * travis/circleci badge
          * violin plots to compare predictions – areas can be colored, different metrics on left and right (like relative...)
        * Release 0.4
          * names of datasets passed in (now default ordinal numbers)
          * holiday/fourier features model
          * fix viz module to have less of important stuff
          * a gif with project visualization
          * check shapes of input arrays (target vs preds), now it doesn't raise an error
          * Baseline prediction using target dataset (without explicit calculation, but losing some time points)
          * Graph: plot confint
        
        
        ## 💡 Ideas
        
        * components
          * Graph: Visualize outliers from confidence interval
          * Multi-comparison component: scikit_posthocs lib or homecooked?
          * inspect true confidence interval coverage via sampling (was done in postings around bayesian dropout sampling)
          * xarrays: compare if compared datasets are actually equal (offets by dates, shapes, maybe even hashing)
          * bin together step performance, like steps 0-1, 2-5, 6-12, 13-24
          * highlight regions using a mask (holidays, etc.)
          * option to view interactively points using widget (plotly)?
          * diagnostics: bias to over / underestimate points
          * animated graphs for change in seasonality
        * features
          * example notebook for fourier?
          * tests for fourier
          * nint generation
        * utils:
          * model adaptor (for different models, generic) which generates 3d prediction dataset. For stastmodels using dyn forecast or kalman filter
          * future importance calculator, but only if I can manipulate input features
          * feature selection using PACF / prewhiten?
        * project
          * more defensive style (add arg checks, so it's easier to understand what is going on)
          * docstrings
          * circleci
          * https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/ for docs
        * sMAPE & MASE can be added for the jupyter evaluation tables
        * ? Residual stats: since I have residuals => Ljung-Box, Heteroscedasticity test, Jarque-Bera – like in statsmodels results,
          but probably these stats were inspected already by the user... and on which step should they be computed then?
        
        
        ## 🤹🏼‍♂️ Development
        
        Recommended development workflow:
        ```
        pipenv install -e .[dev]
        pipenv shell
        ```
        The library doesn't use Flit/Poetry, so the suggested workflow is based on Pipenv (as per https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1911).
        Pipfile* are ignored in the .gitignore.
