Description: # openapi2oms
        This tool aims to convert an OpenAPI 3 spec to its corresponding OMS
        equivalent. Not all features are supported, and some assumptions have
        been made. Please read the caveats section to understand these
        assumptions. 
        
        ## Storyscript
        ```coffee
        result = openapi2oms convert spec: openApiSpec properties: {"serverIndex": 0}
        ```  
        
        ## Caveats
        ### Assumptions
        1. If there are multiple content types available for a given path, the content type
           `application/json` shall be preferred if available. If `application/json` is not
           available, then an appropriate content type will be chosen arbitrarily
        2. OMS doesn't support multiple responses. As such, the following order of response
           codes are considered as successful operations: `200, 201, 202, 2XX, 204, default`.
           Furthermore, since multiple content types are not supported, `application/json`
           will be used if available. If `application/json` is not available, then an
           appropriate content type will be chosen arbitrarily
