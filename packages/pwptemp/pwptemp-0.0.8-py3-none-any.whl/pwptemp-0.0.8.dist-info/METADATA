## Introduction
Pwptemp is a small LGPL licensed library for easy calculation of the
temperature distribution along the well. Features are added as they
are needed; suggestions and contributions of all kinds are very welcome.

To catch up on the latest development and features, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Get pwptemp

* Users: Wheels for Python from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pwptemp/) 
    * `pip install pwptemp`
* Developers: Source code from [github](https://github.com/pro-well-plan/pwptemp)
    * `git clone https://github.com/pro-well-plan/pwptemp`

## Tutorial

You can use the package by creating a new file and by following the instructions provided below.

### Basics   

1. Installing the package:
   > Option 1: Go to project interpreter settings and search pwptemp.

   > Option 2: Go to the terminal and type `pip install pwptemp`

2. Import pwptemp:
```
import pwptemp
```

3. Import the dictionary with default values:
```
tdata = pwptemp.input.tdict(deltaz)
```

4. Define wellpath (create a vertical well):
```
depths = pwptemp.wellpath.get(target_depth, deltaz)
```

5. Create a new well instance:
```
well = pwptemp.input.set_well(tdata, depths)
```

6. Calculating temperature distribution:
```
temp_distribution = pwptemp.main.temp_time(circulation_time, well)
```
*circulation_time in hours

7. Plotting Temperature profile:
```
pwptemp.graph.plot_temp_profile(temp_distribution, well)
```


### Inputs

Around 43 data [inputs](https://github.com/pro-well-plan/pwptemp/blob/master/physics/inputs.md) (such as depths, diameters, temperatures, densities and operation parameters) are involved in pwptemp. However default values are provided in order to only change the parameters that the user wants to load.

### Outputs

Pwptemp allows users to count with heat data for different sections of a well and also to calculate the temperature values at certain circulation times (drilling operation).

```
Temperature of the fluid inside the Drill String (Tdsi)
Temperature of the Drill String Wall (Tds)
Temperature of the fluid inside the Annular (Ta)
Temperature of the Casing (Tcsg)
Temperature of the Riser (Tr)
Temperature of the Surrounding Space (Tsr)
Temperature of the Formation (Tfm)
```

> Note 1: Above seabed, casing section is replaced with the riser and surrounding space would be sea water.

> Note 2: Beyond the 'undisturbed formation zone' the temperature keeps constant (Tfm).
