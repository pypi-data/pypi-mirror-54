# PyCorda

Access node and vault data for analytics using pandas DataFrames. Currently only works with H2 database. 
We'll be adding other DBs shortly and possibly support for queryable states.

## PyCorda.com
Access docs on PyCorda.com (coming soon)

## Example

```
import pycorda as pyc

url = 'jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:52504/node'
username = 'sa'
password = ''
node = pyc.Node(url, username, password)
print(node.get_node_infos())
node.close()
```

## Installation

To get started using the PyCorda library, install it with

```
pip install pycorda
```

If there is a H2 server running with tcp connections allowed,
then you can connect to a database located at the JDBC url with:

```
from pycorda import Node
node = Node(url, username, password)
```

An h2.jar file is required in your projects local folder. If your H2 jar file is elsewhere in your filesystem, try this. This needs to be done only once:

```
from pycorda import Node
node = Node(url, username, password, path_to_jar)
```
Accepted JDBC urls are in the format jdbc:h2:tcp://hostname:portnumber/path_to_database.

## Managing H2 Jars

An h2.jar file stored locally in the project folder is required. H2Tools allows you to pull
a jar programmatically. You'll need to do this once, so either manually or programmatically is fine
as long as the h2.jar file is there.

```
import pycorda as pyc
h2 = pyc.H2Tools()
ver = h2.get_latest_version()
print(ver)
h2.download_h2jar() # downloads latest h2 jar and stores in local folder as h2.jar
```

## Requirements

1. Currently supports 64-bit versions of Python 3 and JVMs only
2. Drop an H2 jar into your project file naming it h2.jar
