===================================
 Database-Specific Adapter Options
===================================

Each adapter supports one common option:

driver
    The name of the driver to use for this database. Defaults to
    "auto", meaning to choose the best driver from among the
    possibilities. Most of the time this option should be omitted and
    RelStorage will choose the best option.

    This is handy to set when an environment might have multiple
    drivers installed, some of which might be non-optimal. For
    example, on PyPy, PyMySQL is generally faster than MySQLdb, but
    both can be installed (in the form of mysqlclient for the latter).

    This is also convenient when using zodbshootout to compare driver
    speeds.

    If you specify a driver that is not installed, an error will be raised.

    Each adapter will document the available driver names.

PostgreSQL Adapter Options
==========================

RelStorage 3.0 requires PostgreSQL 9.6 or above.

.. tip::

   PostgreSQL defaults to storing persistent object state data (pickles)
   on disk in a compressed format if they are longer than roughly
   2,000 bytes. Thus wrapper storages like ``zc.zlibstorage`` are
   unlikely to save much disk space. They may still reduce network
   traffic, however, at the cost of CPU usage in the Python process.

   If you used a compressing wrapper, `you can disable this disk
   compression
   <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html#STORAGE-TOAST-ONDISK>`_
   with the SQL command ``ALTER TABLE object_state ALTER COLUMN STATE
   SET storage EXTERNAL``.

The PostgreSQL adapter accepts:

driver
    All of these drivers use the name of the corresponding PyPI
    package. All drivers support uploading objects using PostgreSQL's
    fast binary COPY protocol (except where noted). The possible options are:

    psycopg2
      A C-based driver that requires the PostgreSQL development
      libraries. Optimal on CPython, but not compatible with gevent.
      Non-production, experimental usage, can install the
      ``psycopg2-binary`` package to be able to use this driver
      without `needing a C compiler
      <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html#binary-packages>`_.

    gevent psycopg2
      The same as ``psycopg2``, but made to be gevent compatible
      through the use of a wait callback. If the system is
      monkey-patched by gevent, RelStorage will automatically install
      a wait callback (which is global to all connections created by
      psycopg2). Otherwise, you must install a compatible wait
      callback (perhaps using `psycogreen
      <https://pypi.org/project/psycogreen/>`__). This driver forfeits
      use of the COPY protocol and use of the C-accelerated BLOBs.

    psycopg2cffi
      A C-based driver that requires the PostgreSQL development
      libraries. Optimal on PyPy and almost indistinguishable from
      psycopg2 on CPython. Not compatible with gevent.

    pg8000
     A pure-Python driver suitable for use with gevent. Works on all
     supported platforms.

     This driver makes use of ``SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS`` and thus
     `may not work well
     <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.set_session>`_
     with certain configurations of connection load balancers.

dsn
    Specifies the data source name for connecting to PostgreSQL.
    A PostgreSQL DSN is a list of parameters separated with
    whitespace.  A typical DSN looks like::

        dbname='zodb' user='username' host='localhost' password='pass'

    If dsn is omitted, the adapter will connect to a local database with
    no password.  Both the user and database name will match the
    name of the owner of the current process.

MySQL Adapter Options
=====================

RelStorage 3.0 requires MySQL 5.7.19 or above; 5.7.21 or higher, or
MySQL 8.0.16 or higher, is recommended.

.. note::

   MySQL versions earlier than 8.0.16 do not support or preserve table
   ``CHECK`` constraints. Upgrading a RelStorage schema from 5.7.x to
   8.0.x will thus not have any defined or enforced table ``CHECK``
   constraints, but creating a new RelStorage schema under MySQL 8.0
   will include enforced ``CHECK`` constraints.

.. caution::

   MySQL 5.0.18 and earlier contain crashing bugs. See :pr:`287` for
   details.

The MySQL adapter accepts most parameters supported by the mysqlclient
library (the maintained version of MySQL-python), including:

driver
    The possible options are:

    MySQLdb
      A C-based driver that requires the MySQL client development
      libraries.. This is best provided by the PyPI distribution
      `mysqlclient <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient>`_.
      This driver is *not* compatible with gevent.

    gevent MySQLdb
      Like ``MySQLdb``, but explicitly uses's gevent's event loop to
      avoid blocking on the socket as much as possible when
      communicating with MySQL.

      Note that this is fairly coarse-grained: When sending a query,
      we can only yield until the socket is ready to write, and then
      we must write the entire query (because that portion is
      implemented in C). Likewise, we can only yield until results are
      ready to be read, and then we must read the entire query.

    PyMySQL
      A pure-Python driver provided by the distribution of the same
      name. It works with CPython 2 and 3 and PyPy (where it is
      preferred). It is compatible with gevent if gevent's
      monkey-patching is used.

    Py MySQL Connector/Python
      This is the `official client
      <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/>`_ provided by
      Oracle. It generally cannot be installed from PyPI or by pip if
      you want the optional C extension. It has an optional C
      extension that must be built manually. The C extension (which
      requires the MySQL client development libraries) performs
      about as well as mysqlclient, but the pure-python version
      somewhat slower than PyMySQL. However, it supports more advanced
      options for failover and high availability.

      RelStorage will only use the pure-Python implementation when
      using this name; this is compatible with gevent.

      Binary packages are distributed by Oracle for many platforms
      and include the necessary native libraries and C extension.

      .. versionadded:: 2.1a1

    C MySQL Connector/Python
      The same as above, but RelStorage will only use the C extension.
      This is not compatible with gevent.

      .. caution::

         At least through version 8.0.16, this driver is not
         recommended.

         It fails the checks established by `CPython 3.7's development
         mode
         <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDEVMODE>`_;
         trying to use it with development mode enabled will crash the
         interpreter with "Fatal Python error: Python memory allocator
         called without holding the GIL." This signals potentially
         serious internal problems.

Oracle Adapter Options
======================

The Oracle adapter accepts:

driver
    Other than "auto" the only supported value is "cx_Oracle".

    .. caution::
        (This is a historical note. Only version 6.0 and above of
        cx_Oracle is supported in RelStorage 3.)

        If you use cx_Oracle 5.2.1 or 5.3 (in general, any version >=
        5.2 but < 6.0) you must be sure that it is compiled against a
        version of the Oracle client that is compatible with the
        Oracle database to which you will be connecting.

        Specifically, if you will be connecting to Oracle database 11
        or earlier, you must *not* compile against client version 12.
        (Compiling against an older client and connecting to a newer
        database is fine.) If you use a client that is too new,
        RelStorage will fail to commit with the error ``DatabaseError:
        ORA-03115: unsupported network datatype or representation``.

        For more details, see :issue:`172`.

user
    The Oracle account name

password
    The Oracle account password

dsn
    The Oracle data source name.  The Oracle client library will
    normally expect to find the DSN in ``/etc/oratab``.

SQLite Adapter Options
======================

A SQLite database can be used by multiple processes concurrently, but
because it uses shared memory, those processes *must* all be on the
same machine.

Using a persistent cache file is not recommended with this adapter.
Indeed, consider disabling RelStorage's in-memory pickle cache
altogether (``cache-local-mb 0``) and allow the operating system's
filesystem cache to serve that purpose.

For more, see :doc:`faq`.

There is only one option:

path
    The path to the main database file.

    Choosing a dedicated directory is recommended. A network
    filesystem is generally not recommended.

    Several other files will be created in the same directory as this
    file while the database is in use. Do not remove them or data
    corruption may result.
