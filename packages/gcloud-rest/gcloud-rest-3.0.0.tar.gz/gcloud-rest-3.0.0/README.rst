[deprecated] RESTful Google Cloud Client Library for Python
===========================================================

This repository has been deprecated -- please see `talkiq/gcloud-aio`_. What
was previously released as ``gcloud-rest`` (and its subprojects, such as
``gcloud-rest-datastore``) is now autogenerated from the much more up-to-date
``gcloud-aio`` repository.
