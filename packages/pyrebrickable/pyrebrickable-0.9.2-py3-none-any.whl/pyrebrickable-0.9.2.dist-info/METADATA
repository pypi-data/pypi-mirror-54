This is pyrebrickable, tools for the www.rebrickable.com website

It provides:
* an auto-generated rebrickable API (in rebrickable.api)
* a CLI wrapper around that API (in rebrickable.cli)

To use the CLI, first register your API key with `rebrickable register`

Then login with `rebrickable users login`

Afterards, you can use the LEGO API through `rebrickable lego`, to access
data about sets, parts, etc

To use the user API, use `rebrickable user`, to access and modify data about
user sets, set lists ,etc

* a SQLalchemy wrapper around the monthly database dumps (in rebrickable.data)

It uses the monthly data dumps (https://www.rebrickable.com/downloads) and provides
SQLAlchemy models to query the data inside. Data is stored in a local SQLite file
in your user directory (inside %APPDATA% on Windows, ~/.local/share on Linux, ~/Library/Application Support/ on MacOS)

`rebrickable data download` to download csv files from rebrickable
`rebrickable data import` to import them in a database
`rebrickable data reset-db` to reset the database
#EXPERIMENTAL# `rebrickable data download-extra` to download data from rebrickable that are not in the dumps (e.g. MOCs data)

see some examples in examples folder
