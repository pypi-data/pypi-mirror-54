        Quickstart Guide
        ================
        
        `CoinBag` objects hold a number of galleons, sickles, and knuts. There are 29 knuts per sickle, and 17 sickles per galleon. The `CoinBag` objects represent an amount of coins, not an amount of money. A `CoinBag` cannot have fractional amounts of coins or negative amounts of coins.
        
        
            >>> bag = CoinBag(galleons=2, sickles=5, knuts=10)
            >>> bag.galleons
            2
            >>> bag.sickles
            5
            >>> bag.knuts
            10
            >>> bag.value
            1141
            >>> bag.knuts = 20
            >>> bag.value
            1151
            >>> bag.convertToSickles()
            >>> str(bag)
            '0g,39s,20k'
            >>> bag + bag
            CoinBag(galleons=0, sickles=78, knuts=40)
            >>> bag += CoinBag(1, 0, 0)
            >>> str(bag)
            '1g,39s,20k'
            >>> bag.convertToGalleons()
            >>> str(bag)
            '3g,5s,20k'
            >>> del bag.knuts
            >>> str(bag)

            ['galleon', 'galleon', 'galleon', 'sickle', 'sickle', 'sickle', 'sickle', 'sickle']
            >>> bag *= 2
            >>> str(bag)
            '6g,10s,0k'
            >>> bag2 = CoinBag()
            >>> str(bag2)
            '0g,0s,0k'
            >>> bag >> bag2
            >>> str(bag)
            '0g,0s,0k'
            >>> str(bag2)
