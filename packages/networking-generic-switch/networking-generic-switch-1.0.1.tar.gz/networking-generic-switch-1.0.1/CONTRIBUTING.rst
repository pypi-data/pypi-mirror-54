Creating new device plugins
===========================

#. Subclass the abstract class
   ``networking_generic_switch.devices.GenericSwitch``
   and implement all the abstract methods it defines.

   * Your class must accept a single argument for instantiation -
      a dictionary with all fields given in the device config section
      of the ML2 plugin config.
      This will be available as ``self.config`` in the instantiated object.

#. Register your class under ``generic_switch.devices`` entrypoint.
#. Add your device config to the plugin configuration file
   (``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_genericswitch.ini`` by default).
   The only required option is ``device_type`` that must be equal to the
   entrypoint you have registered your plugin under, as it is used for plugin
   lookup (see provided ``Netmiko``-based plugins for example).
