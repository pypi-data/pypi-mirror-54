Installation
============

**Dependencies**

* Python_ >=2.7 or >=3.4
* `PyYAML <https://pyyaml.org/>`_ Optional. It's needed only
  if you use yaml :ref:`buildconf<buildconf>`.


There are different ways to install/use ZenMake:

.. contents::
   :local:

Via python package (pip)
------------------------
ZenMake has `own python package <pypipkg_>`_. So you can install it as::

    pip install zenmake

In this way pip will install PyYAML if it's not installed already.

.. note::
    ``POSIX``: It requires root and will install it system-wide.
    Alternatively, you can use::

        pip install --user zenmake

    which will install it for your user
    and does not require any special privileges. This will install the package
    in ~/.local/, so you will have to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH.

    ``Windows``: It doesn't always require administrator rights.

.. note::
    You need to have ``pip`` installed. Most of the modern Linux distributions
    have pip in their packages. On Windows you can use, for example,
    `chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/>`_.
    Common instructions to install pip can be found
    `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.

.. note::
    You can install zenmake with pip and virtualenv_. In this case you don't
    touch system packages and it doesn't require root privileges.

After installing you can run zenmake just by typing::

    zenmake

.. _installation-via-git:

Via git
----------

You can use zenmake from Git repository. But branch ``master`` can be
broken. Also you can just to switch to desirable version using git tag. Each
version of zenmake has git tag. Body of zenmake application is located in
``src/zenmake`` path in repository. So you don't needed other directories and
files in repository and remove them if you want. Then you can make symlink
to ``src/zenmake/zmrun.py``, shell alias or make callable
.sh script (for Linux/MacOS/..) or .bat (for Windows) to
run zenmake. Example for Linux (``zmrepo`` is custom directory)::

    $ mkdir zmrepo
    $ cd zmrepo
    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/pustotnik/zenmake.git .

Next step is optional. Switch to version 0.4.0. Version can be any existing::

    $ git checkout v0.4.0

Here you can make symlink/alias/script to run zenmake.
Variants to run zenmake from current directory::

    $ src/zenmake/zmrun.py
    $ python src/zenmake

.. note::
    To use yaml build configs you need to install PyYAML
    (with pip or system package manager).

As a zip application
------------------------
Zenmake can be run as executable python zip application. And zenmake can make
such zipapp itself with command ``zipapp``.
Using steps from `Via Git <installation-via-git_>`_ you can run::

    $ python src/zenmake zipapp
    $ ls *.pyz
    zenmake.pyz
    $ ./zenmake.pyz
    ...

Resulting file ``zenmake.pyz`` can be used as is without repository and pip
excepting PyYAML must be installed if you want to use yaml build configs.
So you can copy ``zenmake.pyz`` in root of your project and distribute this
file with your project. It can be used on any supported platform and doesn't
require any additional access and changes in your system.
