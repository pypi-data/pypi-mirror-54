Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------

ZenMake is a build system based on the meta build system/framework Waf_.
Main purpose of the project is to be as simple as possible to use
but be flexible.

Details about reasons to create this project you can find :ref:`here<why>`.

It uses WAF as internal engine. It's for C/C++ projects
now but may be later some other languages will be added. Especially WAF
supports a lot of other programming languages for building.

Main features
-------------
    - Easy to use and flexible build config as python (.py) or as yaml file.
      Details are :ref:`here<buildconf>`.
    - Distribution as zip application or as system package (pip).
      See :ref:`Installation<installation>`.
    - Automatic build order and dependencies. (Thanks to Waf_)
    - Automatic reconfiguring: no need to run command 'configure'.
    - Possibility to autodetect a compiler. (Thanks to Waf_)
    - Building and running functional/unit tests including possibility to
      build and run tests only on changes. Details are :ref:`here<buildtests>`.
    - Running custom scripts during build phase.
    - Supported platforms: GNU/Linux, MacOS, MS Windows. Also some other
      platforms like FreeBSD should be supported but they aren't tested.
    - Supported languages: C, C++
    - Supported compilers: at least gcc, clang and msvc. But actually all
      compilers that Waf_ supports.

Plans to do
------------

There is no clear roadmap for this project. I add features that I think are
needed to include. Also I'm ready to consider user requests to
add/change something.
