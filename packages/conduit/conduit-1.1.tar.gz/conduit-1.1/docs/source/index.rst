Conduit
=======

Conduit is a stream transformation library designed to support power engineering analytics. In particular, Conduit integrates deeply with the `Berkeley Tree Database (BTrDB) <http://btrdb.io>`_ using the `btrdb-python <https://btrdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ bindings to manage stream metadata and apply transformations to individual streams, phasors, phasor pairs, and phasor groups.
