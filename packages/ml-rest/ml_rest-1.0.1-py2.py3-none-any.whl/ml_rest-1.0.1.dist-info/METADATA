This project is dedicated to the easy and simple implementation of trained machine learning models

currently, this project has some strict dependencies to Tensorflow 1.12.0, however, there are some security concerns that need to be addressed in this version. Some updates will be necessary to make this library compliant with newer versions of tensorflow
