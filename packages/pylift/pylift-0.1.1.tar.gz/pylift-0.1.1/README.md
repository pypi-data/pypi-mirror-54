**pylift** is an uplift library that provides, primarily, (1) fast uplift
modeling implementations and (2) evaluation tools. While other packages and
more exact methods exist to model uplift, **pylift** is designed to be quick,
flexible, and effective. **pylift** heavily leverages the optimizations of
other packages -- namely, `xgboost`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`,
`numpy`, and `scipy`. The primary method currently implemented is the
Transformed Outcome proxy method (Athey 2015).
