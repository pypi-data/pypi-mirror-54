    Never touch this package to adjust configuration or customize parts, there is no need for that.
    Read the documentation please: http://docs.plone.org/...

Configuration
=============

Edit the "conf.py" configuration file to point to the plone themes::

    # At the top.
    import sphinxtheme.plone

    # ...

    html_theme_path = sphinxtheme.plone.get_html_theme_path()

    # Activate the theme like this:
    html_theme = 'plone_org_4'

Additional switches for the theme, see detailed documentation.
For the current docs.plone.org, **always** set the following (this should be done in the conf.py of the related papyrus branch):

always_show_language_switcher = True
selected_version = *the version of the docs that should come preselected in the dropdown, so 5, 4 or 3*
