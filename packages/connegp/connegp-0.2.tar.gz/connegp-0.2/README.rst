Conneg by P
============
This small library module assists with tasks related to `Content Negotiation by Profile <https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/>`_, which is a `W3C Standard <https://www.w3.org/standards/>`_ about *how Internet clients may negotiate for content provided by servers based on data profiles to which the content conforms*.

Library Structure
------------------
The library really only consists of a few classes:

* :code:`LinkHeaderParser`

  * parses ``Link`` headers, of the sort generated by Conneg by P HTTP *Functional Profile*-compliant systems
  * can separate out profiles, described as per the Conneg by P HTTP's `list profiles <https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/#http-listprofiles>`_ function
  * can separate out profile URI/token mappings, as per the Conneg by P `Link Attributes <#link-attributes>`_ specification.

* :code:`AcceptProfileHeaderParser`

  * parses ``Accept-Profile`` headers, of the sort needed to be supplied by clients when requesting content by profile according to Conneg by P's HTTP *Functional Profile*
