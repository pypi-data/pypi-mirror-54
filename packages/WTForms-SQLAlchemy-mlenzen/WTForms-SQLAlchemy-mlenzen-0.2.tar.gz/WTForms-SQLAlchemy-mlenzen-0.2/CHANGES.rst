Version 0.2
-----------

Unreleased

-   Fork the irregularly maintained WTForms-SQLAlchemy
-   Auto-generated ``DecimalField`` does not limit places for ``Float``
    columns. (`#2`_)
-   Add an example of using this library with Flask-SQAlchemy. (`#3`_)
-   Generating a form from a model copies any lists of validators
    passed in ``field_args`` to prevent modifying a shared value across
    forms. (`#5`_)
-   Don't add a ``Length`` validator when the column's length is not an
    int. (`#6`_)
-   Add ``QueryRadioField``, like ``QuerySelectField`` except
    it renders a list of radio fields. Add ``QueryCheckboxField``, like
    ``QuerySelectMultipleField`` except it renders a list of checkbox
    fields. (`#8`_)
-   Fix a compatibility issue with SQLAlchemy 2.1 that caused
    ``QuerySelectField`` to fail with a ``ValueError``. (`#9`_, `#10`_,
    `#11`_)
-   ``QuerySelectField.query`` allows no results. (`#12`_)
