Description: RobotNotifications
        ===============
        
        Send notifications to Slack or Mattermost using Robot Framework.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The recommended installation method is pip:
        
            pip install robotframework-notifications
        
        Running this command installs also the latest version of Requests
        
        Import Library
        -----
        
        To use RobotNotifications in Robot Framework, the library needs to be imported using the ``Library`` setting as any other library. The library needs the webhook url from Slack or Mattermost as an argument.
        
        
            *** Settings ***
            Library         RobotNotifications   https://hooks.slack.com/services/--your-webhook--
        
        You can retrieve this webhook url in Slack or Mattermost.

        Usage
        -----
        
        After importing the library you have access to the keyword ``Post Message To Channel``
        
        This keyword has one mandatory argument which is the message to post to the channel, and several optional arguments.
        
        | Argument   | Description                                                  | Required |
        | ---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
        | text       | Markdown-formatted message to display in the post.           | YES      |
        | channel    | Overrides the channel the message posts in. Use the channelâ€™s name and not the display name. Defaults to the channel set during webhook creation. | NO       |
        | username   | Overrides the username the message posts as. Defaults to the username set during webhook creation or the webhook creatorâ€™s username if the former was not set. | NO       |
        | icon_url   | Overrides the profile picture the message posts with. Defaults to the URL set during webhook creation or the webhook creatorâ€™s profile picture if the former was not set. | NO       |
        | icon_emoji | Overrides the profile picture and `icon_url` parameter. Defaults to none and is not set during webhook creation. | NO       |
        | props      | Sets the post `props`, a JSON property bag for storing extra or meta data on the post. | NO       |
        
        Example
        -----
        
            *** Settings ***
            Library         RobotNotifications   https://hooks.slack.com/services/--your-webhook--
            Suite Setup     Start Suite
            Test Teardown   Message On Failure     
            
            *** Keywords ***
            Start Suite
                Post Message To Channel      Testing has started!    icon_emoji=robot_face    username=Robot    
                ...                          channel=robot-notifications
            
            Message On Failure
                Run Keyword If Test Failed   Post Message To Channel   ${TEST_NAME}\n${TEST_MESSAGE}   
                ...                          icon_emoji=rage   username=Robot Error   channel=robot-notifications
            
            *** Test Cases ***
            This Test Will Pass
                Log   This Test Will Pass
            
            This Test Will Fail
                Log   ${ERROR}
            
        
        The above example shows how the ``Post Message To Channel`` can be used in Robot Framework.
        
        You can for example use the keyword in a test teardown to post a message if the test failed containing the test name and error message.
