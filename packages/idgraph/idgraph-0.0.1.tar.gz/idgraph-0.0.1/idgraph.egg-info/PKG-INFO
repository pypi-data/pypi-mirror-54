        Provides IPython cell magic for `dgraph <https://dgraph.io/>`__ remote
        interaction.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install idgraph
        
        Why is this?
        ------------
        
        While `dgraph <https://dgraph.io>`__ provides several useful interfaces,
        I spend most of my time learning, exploring, and developing in
        `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__. Executable documentation is
        fantastic! This package abstractly provides cell magic for dgraph query,
        mutation, and alteration execution. You could do the same with ``curl``
        or ``requests``. But, the sensible defaults help make things less
        verbose and tedious. (It's inspired by my experience with
        `itikz <https://github.com/jbn/itikz>`__ which proved really
        beneficial.)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The easiest way to understand how this works is by following (and cloning)
        the `tutorial notebook <https://github.com/jbn/idgraph/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb>`__.
        It's a projection dgraph's
        `Tour of Dgraph: A Bigger Dataset <https://tour.dgraph.io/moredata/1/>`__.
        
        Cheat Sheet
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Load the extension with,
        
        .. code::
        
            %load_ext idgraph
        
        Then,
        
        -  By default, ``%%dgraph`` assumes a query.
        
           -  ``%%dgraph --alter`` does an alteration
           -  ``%%dgraph --mutate`` does a mutation
        
        -  By default, ``%%dgraph`` assumes ``localhost:8080``
        
           -  ``%%dgraph --addr=remote-host:8080`` overrides the default
           -  The ``DGRAPH_ADDR`` environmental variable overrides default if
              the ``--addr`` flag isn't set
        
        -  By default, only the value associated with the ``data`` key in the
           response is shown.
        
           -  ``%%dgraph --full-resp`` shows the full response including
              metadata.
           -  ``%%dgraph --jmespath="query"`` allows you to extract part of the
              response with a `jmespath <http://jmespath.org/>`__ query.
        
        -  By default, each cell execution binds the extracted response to
           ``_dgraph`` and the full response to ``_dgraph_full``
        
           -  ``%%dgraph --into=name`` will bind the extracted response to
              ``name`` and the full response to ``{name}_full``
        
        -  By default, the cell contents are executed.
        
           -  ``%%dgraph --skip`` skips execution.
        
              -  Useful for mutations that are possibly dangerous on someone
                 else's computer.
        
        -  Jinja
        
           -  technically you can use templates in a directory. you almost
              certainly shouldnt though.
