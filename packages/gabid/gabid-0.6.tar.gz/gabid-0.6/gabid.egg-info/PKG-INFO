Description: # gabid package
        
        This package implements the Gaussian and Binomial Distributions providing the following capabilities:
        * Compute the mean and standard deviation given a file with all the samples
        * Compute the pdf
        * Allows to add two of the kind
        
        For Gaussian distribution only:
        * Plot histogram
        * Plot histogram pdf
        
        For Binomial distribution only:
        * Plot bar
        * Plot bar pdf
        
        ## Installation
        
        To start using this package just type: `pip install gabid`
        
        ## Files
        
        This package provides three classes: `Distribution`, `Gaussian` and `Binomial`.
        The `Distribution` class is only used to read all the values from a txt file and convert them into a list.
        Both `Gaussian` and `Binomial` inherit from this class.
        
        ## Quick start
        
        See Gaussian example:
        
        ```
        gaussian = Gaussian(25, 2)
        gaussian.read_data_file('numbers.txt') # numbers.txt is a txt with all the samples
        gaussian.calculate_mean() # to recompute mean according to the data in the txt
        gaussian.calculate_stdev() # to recompute standard deviation according to the data in the txt
        gaussian.pdf(25) # to compute the pdf of a value
        ```
