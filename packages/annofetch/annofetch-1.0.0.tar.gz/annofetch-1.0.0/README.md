AnnoFetch is a command line script that fetches biological annotations for valid
database accessions.
Called with a file containing valid gene or protein accessions it produces a
csv-file containing available annotations for each accession.
Therefore AnnoFetch fetches entries from several databases like Genbank (NCBI),
Ena (EMBL) or UniProtKB and extracts the desired annotations.

A short Tutorial is given in the README.md file
within the Example folder.
