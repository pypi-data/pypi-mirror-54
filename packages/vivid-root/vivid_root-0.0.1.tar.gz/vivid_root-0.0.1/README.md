[![Building Status](https://travis-ci.org/frootlab/aughra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frootlab/aughra)

*Vivid Root* (alias Aughra) is a planned directory service for the
[Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid.html) framework. Vivid Root
is responsible to host and deploy standards for algorithm types, interfaces and
evaluation metrices to [Vivid Stores](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/store.html).
Thereupon Vivid Root provides information about public Vivid Stores, to allow an
automatic configuration of [Vivid Nodes](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/node.html).

Vivid Root is open source, based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
programming language and actively developed as part of the
[Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/vivid) framework at the [Frootlab Organization](https://www.frootlab.org).

Current Development Status
--------------------------

Vivid Root currently is in early *planning* stage. This means, that the
project's directives, requirements and goals are not yet settled and
implemented.
