Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This tool is designed to assist kernel and OS developers in optimizing
their linux stack's suspend/resume time. Using a kernel image built
with a few extra options enabled, the tool will execute a suspend and
capture dmesg and ftrace data until resume is complete. This data is
transformed into a device timeline and an optional callgraph to give
a detailed view of which devices/subsystems are taking the most
time in suspend/resume.
