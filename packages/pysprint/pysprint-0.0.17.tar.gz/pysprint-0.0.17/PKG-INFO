        ##### Spectrally Refined Interferometry for Python 
        CURRENT RELEASE: 
        
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pysprint.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pysprint)
        
        PySprint is a UI and API for interferogram evaluation. Under construction.
        The GUI works only with 1920x1080 screen resolution. Lower resolution compatibility is queued on the To-Do List.
        
        
        ### Lastest upgrades:
          - Now pip installable, see below
          - Added CI/CD, next is CircleCI
          - Data editing features unittests done
          - Added CI along with some unittests
          - Started API
          - Numerous little fixes according to PEP8
          - Added autofit for CFF method, it will be improved later
          - Eval. methods are improved
          - Windows remember their last state, they open as they were closed
          - Added Settings panel for calibration
          - Added SPP Panel
        
        ### Known issues
        * FFTMethod's calculate works incorrectly, fix next release
        * The data loading AI sometimes produces unexpected results
        * There might be unnecessary imports
        * Some buttons has no effect yet.
        
        
        ### To-do list
        * Screen resolution compatibility
        * Clean up GUI from useless buttons
        * ERROR HANDLING!
        * Unittests
        * Selectable units
        * Possible performance enhancement by improving algorithms
        * Possible new data manipulating features + new options for existing ones
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        PySprint requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install pysprint
        ```
        
        Package requirements:
        * To use the GUI, install [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
        ```sh
        $ pip install PyQt5
        ```
        or 
        ```sh
        conda install -c dsdale24 pyqt5
        ```
        * numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, lmfit will be automatically collected.
        
        
        ## To Run the GUI
        ```python
        import pysprint as ps
        
        ps.run()
        ```
