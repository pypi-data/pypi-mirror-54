##### Spectrally Refined Interferometry for Python 
CURRENT RELEASE: 

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pysprint.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pysprint)

**Under construction.**

PySprint is a UI and API for interferogram evaluation. 
The GUI works only with 1920x1080 or bigger screen resolution. Lower resolution compatibility is queued on the To-Do List.

### 0.0.26 release notes and bugfixes
  - Cosine fit method now works correctly, prints coefficient of determination on plot_result call
  - Also Cosine fit method now has a max try count for curve fitting
  - Updated docs
  - Small rework of print_disp decorator function


### 0.0.25 release notes and bugfixes
  - SPP Method's collected data now correctly broadcasted to evaluating function
  - SPP Method now has a reference point arg (also on API)
  - SPP Method's and Generator's GUI is a little bit prettier
  - Generator now correctly handles the delay
  - Added linear chirp parameter to Generator
  - Fixed FWHM and order, now std of gaussian is correctly calculated 
  - API: CosFitMethod now has guess_GD, guess_GDD, etc methods for initial parameters
  - API: CosFitMethod also has a set_max_order method to restrict max order dispersion
  - Added advanced unittests for Fourier Method


### Known issues
* There can be bigger bugs out there, I'm working on a fix.
* There might be unnecessary imports
* Some buttons has no effect yet.
* In the menus some functions are unusually placed.


### To-do list
* Screen resolution compatibility
* Clean up GUI from useless buttons
* ERROR HANDLING!
* Unittests
* Selectable units
* Possible performance enhancement by improving algorithms
* Possible new data manipulating features + new options for existing ones


### Installation

PySprint requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

```sh
$ pip install pysprint
```

Package requirements:
* To use the GUI, install [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
```sh
$ pip install PyQt5
```
or 
```sh
conda install -c dsdale24 pyqt5
```
* numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, lmfit will be automatically collected.


## To Run the GUI
```python
import pysprint as ps

ps.run()
```
