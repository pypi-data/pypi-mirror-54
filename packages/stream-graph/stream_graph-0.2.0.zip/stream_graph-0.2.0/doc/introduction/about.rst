About
-----

This library is an attempt for the modelization of Stream Graphs. A
Stream Graph is a Graph whose nodes and edges (also called *links*) can
appear and disappear throughout time. Inside this module various methods
that facilitate the study of such graphs can be found, both simple as
degree distibutions (over time), as well as complicated like computing
maximal cliques, centrality-scores etc. This library is hence designed
for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of networks, such as
communication dynamics in social media.

A Stream-Graph was first formally defined by Matthieu Latapy et al. in
[`1 <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01665084>`__\ ], as a object
constituted of four components: a) a set of nodes belonging to the
graph, b) a time-set representing the graph's lifespan, c) a
temporal-node-set, that is a set of nodes and times representing the
presence of node, and d) a temporal-link-set, that is a set of node
pairs and times representing the presence of link.
