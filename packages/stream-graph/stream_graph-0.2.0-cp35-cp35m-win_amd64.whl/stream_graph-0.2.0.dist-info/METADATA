This library is an attempt at modelling Stream Graphs.
A Stream Graph is a graph which nodes and links appear and disappear through time.
Various methods that facilitate the study of such graphs can be found in this library, both simple (as degree distribution over time) and sophisticated (as maximal temporal-cliques, temporal-centrality measures).
This library is hence designed for the analysis of the temporal dimension of evolving networks, such as the communication dynamics in social media. 

Stream Graphs were first formally defined by [Matthieu Latapy *et al.*](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01665084) as the generalization of static graphs.
They consist of four components: (1) a set of nodes (`NodeSet`) belonging to the graph, (2) a time interval (`TimeSet`) representing the graph's lifespan, (3) a set of temporal nodes (`TemporalNodeSet`) describing instants when nodes are present in the stream, and (4) a set of temporal links (`TemporalLinkSet`) describing the instants when nodes are interacting in the stream.

**Warning:** This library is currently **under development**. Elementary structures and methods may change, with no support for previous versions.


## Installing the Library

Update: Version `0.2`
---------------------
- Changes in interval-dataframe backbone:
  - Continuous (time) intervals.
  - Discrete (time) Intervals are treated differently
- TODO: More Verification (add continuous bounds for maximal_cliques)


Installing `stream_graph`
-------------------------
The `stream_graph` library requires:

* Python [>=2.7, >=3.5]
* Numpy [>=1.14.0]
* Pandas [>=0.24.0]
* Cython [>=0.27.3]
* six [>=1.11.0]
* Nose [>=1.3.0]
* Cython [>=0.27.3]

In order to allow visualizations, the user should install the latest `bokeh` library.

### Installing Dependencies


To install dependencies:

```shell
pip install extension>=extension_version
```

Or more simply:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please add `sudo` if `pip` does not have superuser privileges.


### Installing the `master` Version


```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/ysig/stream_graph/
```


## Getting Started


For a first introduction to the library, please have a look at [emailEU](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ysig/stream_graph/blob/master/tutorials/emailEU/email-Eu.ipynb) or visit the [tutorials page](https://ysig.github.io/stream_graph/doc/tutorials.html) within the documentation.


## Documentation


The [library documentation](https://ysig.github.io/stream_graph/doc/) is available online and automatically generated with Sphinx.
To generate it yourself, move to `doc` folder and execute: `make clean hmtl`, after having installed all the needed dependencies.
