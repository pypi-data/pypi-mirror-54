# lucia
An audio game engine written in python

### Goals:
The goal of lucia is to change the audio game creation method from the now old and no longer maintained bgt, to python.
Lucia should not act as a starting game, but as a base, that a high quality game can be build upon.
In addition lucia should be cross platform, At Least on windows and mac.
> Code / dependencies that doesn't meet these requirements cannot be a part of lucia.

### Folder explenations:
* Lucia - the main lucia engine.
* lucia/audio - Audio handling.
* lucia/interface - things that pop onto the screen (like menus, edit fields and dialogs).
* lucia/utils - things coded into the engine, but not necessarily required in every game.
And in addition
* doc - documentation for lucia (auto generated)
* examples - Examples that showcases different things that can be done with lucia.
* web - The advanced documentation and use cases for lucia.
* tests - tests for lucia.
