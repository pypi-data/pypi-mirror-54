    1. ON_REQUEST
        the setter is called, when its execution is requested by a method further
        down the processing chain.
    2. ON_NOTIFY
        the setter is called, when the connected getter has computed the input
        value, even if the execution of this setter has not been requested.
    3. ON_ANNOUNCE
        the setter is requests its input value immediately and is executed as soon
        as that is available. But connecting the setter, does not cause a request
        of the input value.
    4. ON_CONNECT
        same as ON_ANNOUNCE, but the value is also requested, when a new connection
        is established, which influences the input value of this connector. This
        connection is does not necessarily have to be with this connector, but it
        can also be further upstream in the processing chain.
