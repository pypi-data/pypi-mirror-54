    Connector proxies are returned by the connector decorators, while the methods

    The actual connector only has a weak reference to its instance, while this
    proxy has a hard reference, but mimics the connector in almost every other
    way. This makes constructions like ``value = Class().connector()`` possible.
    Without the proxy, the instance of the class would be deleted before the connector
    method is called, so that the weak reference of the connector would be expired
    during its call.
