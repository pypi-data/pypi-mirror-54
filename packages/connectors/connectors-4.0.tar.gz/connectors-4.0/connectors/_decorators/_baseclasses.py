        not require any arguments, while for multi-input connectors, it must accept
        the data ID of the connection, through which the announcement was received.

        Before the values in a processing chain are updated, the value changes
        are announced to the downstream processors. Only if data is retrieved
        through an output connector, that has pending announcements, the actual
        value changes are requested from the upstream processors (lazy execution).

        announcements and this condition evaluates to ``False``, the announcements
        are not forwarded to the downstream processors. This also prevents those
        processors from requesting updated values from upstream.

        the method, that is decorated with :class:`connectors.Input`

        The decorated method shall return ``True``, if the notification shall be
        sent and ``False`` otherwise. For normal input connectors, it shall accept
        the new value as an argument, while for multi-input connectors, it must
        accept the data ID of the connection, through which the announcement was
        received and the new value.

        This condition is checked after the input connector (the setter method)
        has been executed. If an input connector has defined a condition on the
        notification of its observing output connectors and this condition evaluates
        to ``False``, the output connectors are sent a cancel notification, that
        informs them, that the state of the object, to which the connectors belong,
        has not changed in a relevant way. This prevents the update of values
        further down the processing chain.
