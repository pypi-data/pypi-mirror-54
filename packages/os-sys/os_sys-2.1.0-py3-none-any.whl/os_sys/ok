hello I am matthijs and i will show you how this text editor works. so lets get started. first of all you need to start up this text editor.
that is realy easy. if you cant find the file text_editor.py you need to go to this path:
{disk}:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python{python version}\\Lib\site-packages\os_sys
then you will find the file text_editor.py. execute the file and you will start up text editor
other way is type this in python:
>>> from os_sys import text_editor

>>> text_editor.main()
that is how you start text editor.
so lets see how it works. so the python code is complex and i won't show you becuse it will take to long to explain everything
but what it does it takes your input. but it not only shows it here but also it will be saved in a file
