        Salt-lint
        =========
        
        ``salt-lint`` checks Salt state files (SLS) for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.
        
        The project is heavily based on `ansible-lint`_, which was created by `Will Thames`_ and is now maintained as part of the `Ansible`_ by `Red Hat`_ project.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Using Pip
        ---------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install salt-lint
        
        From Source
        -----------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/roaldnefs/salt-lint.git
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Command Line Options
        --------------------
        
        The following is the output from ``salt-lint --help``, providing an overview of the basic command line options:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           Usage: salt-lint [options] init.sls [state ...]
        
           Options:
             --version             show program's version number and exit
             -h, --help            show this help message and exit
             -L                    list all the rules
             -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or
                                   more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default
                                   rules in /tmp/saltlint/lib/saltlint/rules, unless -R
                                   is also used.
             -R                    Use default rules in /tmp/saltlint/lib/saltlint/rules
                                   in addition to any extra rules directories specified
                                   with -r. There is no need to specify this if no -r
                                   flags are used.
             -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values
             -T                    list all the tags
             -v                    Increase verbosity level
             -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these
                                   values
             --nocolor             disable colored output
             --force-color         Try force colored output (relying on salt's code)
             --exclude=EXCLUDE_PATHS
                                   path to directories or files to skip. This option is
                                   repeatable.
             -c C                  Specify configuration file to use.  Defaults to
                                   ".salt-lint"
        
        Linting Salt state files
        ------------------------
        
        It's important to note that ``salt-lint`` accepts a list of Salt state files or a list of directories.
        
        GitHub Action
        -------------
        
        Salt-lint is available on the GitHub `marketplace`_ as a GitHub Action. The `salt-lint-action`_ allows you to run ``salt-lint`` with no additional options.
        
        To use the action simply add the following lines to your ``.github/workflows/main.yml``.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            on: [push]
        
            jobs:
              test:
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                name: Salt Lint Action
                steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v1
                - name: Run salt-lint
                  uses: roaldnefs/salt-lint-action@master
                  env:
                    ACTION_STATE_NAME: init.sls
        
        Configuring
        ===========
        
        Configuration File
        ------------------
        
        Salt-lint supports local configuration via a ``.salt-lint`` configuration file. Salt-lint checks the working directory for the presence of this file and applies any configuration found there. The configuration file location can also be overridden via the ``-c path/to/file`` CLI flag.
        
        If a value is provided on both the command line and via a configuration file, the values will be merged (if a list like **exclude_paths**), or the **True** value will be preferred, in the case of something like **quiet**.
        
        The following values are supported, and function identically to their CLI counterparts:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            ---
            exclude_paths:
              - exclude_this_file
              - exclude_this_directory/
              - exclude/this/sub-directory/
            skip_list:
              - 207
              - 208
            tags:
              - formatting
            verbosity: 1
        
        Pre-commit Setup
        ----------------
        
        To use salt-lint with `pre-commit`_,  just add the following to your local repo's ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file. Prior to version 0.12.0 of `pre-commit`_ the file was ``hooks.yaml`` (now ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``).
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            ---
        
            # For use with pre-commit.
            # See usage instructions at http://pre-commit.com
        
            -   id: salt-lint
                name: Salt-lint
                description: This hook runs salt-lint.
                entry: salt-lint
                language: python
                files: \.(sls)$
        
        Rules
        =====
        
        False Positives: Skipping Rules
        -------------------------------
        
        Some rules are bit of a rule of thumb. To skip a specific rule for a specific task, inside your state add ``# noqa [rule_id]`` at the end of the line. You can skip multiple rules via a space-separated list. Example:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            /tmp/testfile:
              file.managed:
                - source: salt://{{unspaced_var}}/example  # noqa: 206
