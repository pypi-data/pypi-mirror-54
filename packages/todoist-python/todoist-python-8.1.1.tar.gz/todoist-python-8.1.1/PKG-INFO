Description: # todoist-python - The official Todoist Python API library
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Install with
        
        ```bash
        pip install todoist-python
        ```
        
        Official Documentation can be found at
        https://todoist-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
        
        ## Example Usage
        
        Import the library and try some commands:
        
        ```python
        $ python
        >>> import todoist
        >>> api = todoist.TodoistAPI('0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567')
        >>> api.sync()
        >>> full_name = api.state['user']['full_name']
        >>> print(full_name)
        John Doe
        >>> for project in api.state['projects']:
        ...     print(project['name'])
        ...
        Personal
        Shopping
        Work
        Errands
        Movies to watch
        ```
        
        ## Building from Source
        
        ### Build Project
        
        Requirements:
        
        - Python 2.7+
        - PIP: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        - Virtualenv: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
        
        Clone the repo and enter it:
        
            $ git clone git@github.com:Doist/todoist-python.git ; cd todoist-python
        
        Create an environment:
        
            $ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p /usr/bin/python2.7 Env
        
        Activate the environment:
        
            $ source Env/bin/activate
        
        Install the library along with all the dependencies (so far we depend on awesome
        requests only):
        
            $ pip install -e .
        
        ### Build Documentation
        
        If you want to build the documentation as well, install some extra packages:
        
            $ pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
        
        Build the documentation:
        
            $ (cd doc ; make html)
        
        Read the built documentation by opening:
        
            doc/_build/html/index.html
        
        ## Testing the library
        
        We have a set of tests to ensure we support Python both 2.x and 3.x. To test it
        out, please make sure you have python 2.7 and python 3.4 installed in you
        system. Then install "tox" either globally (preferred way) or in your local
        environment.
        
            # apt-get install python-tox
        
        or
        
            $ pip install tox
        
        
        You will also need to have the `pytest.ini` file. We are providing a
        `pytest.ini.sample` that you can copy and paste to create your own
        `pytest.ini`. You will need two different tokens (`token` and `token2` keys on
        on `pytest.ini`) to be able to run all the tests successfully.
        
        With everything set up, you can just run:
        
            $ tox
