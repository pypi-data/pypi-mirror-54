Description: ========================
        Zeep: Python SOAP client 
        ========================
        
        This is a fork of (mvantellingen/python-zeep)[https://github.com/mvantellingen/python-zeep]. For now it just runs the plugins after signing when making the request, and before when processing the response.
        
        We did this because we needed to encrypt in those moments and we didn't saw a way to do it. So we used plugins to do it, and needed to encrypt after sign in the request and before in the response.
        
        Maybe in the future we could implement a "Encryption Plugin" and return the "Normal Plugin" execution where it belongs.
        
        A fast and modern Python SOAP client
        
        Highlights:
         * Compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and PyPy
         * Build on top of lxml and requests
         * Support for Soap 1.1, Soap 1.2 and HTTP bindings
         * Support for WS-Addressing headers
         * Support for WSSE (UserNameToken / x.509 signing)
         * Support for tornado async transport via gen.coroutine (Python 2.7+)
         * Support for asyncio via aiohttp (Python 3.5+)
         * Experimental support for XOP messages
