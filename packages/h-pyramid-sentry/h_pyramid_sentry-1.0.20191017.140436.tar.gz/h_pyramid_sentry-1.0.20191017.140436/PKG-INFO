Description: Hypothesis Pyramid Sentry Extension
        ===================================
        
        A library which integrates [Sentry](https://sentry.io) logging into Pyramid
        with the ability to filter out unwanted messages.
        
        What should I use this for?
        ---------------------------
        
        At the moment the library is mostly being used as an experimental testing
        ground and therefore is not recommended for general use.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        In your Pyramid configuration you need to provide a list of filter functions
        in the parameter `h_pyramid_sentry.filters`.
        
        These functions are passed [Event](h_pyramid_sentry/event.py) objects which
        they can inspect. If the function returns `True`, then the event is logged
        locally, but not sent to Sentry
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```python
        # Hook into Pyramid
        config.add_settings({
            # Any options supported by sentry_sdk.init
            "h_pyramid_sentry.init.environment": "<my_sentry_env>",
            "h_pyramid_sentry.filters": [
                lambda event: instanceof(event.exception, ValueError)
            ],
            "h_pyramid_sentry.retry_support": True
        })
        
        config.include("h_pyramid_sentry")
        ```
        
        Sentry configuration
        --------------------
        
        The Sentry integration will listen to the following Pyramid deployment settings:
        
        | Pyramid setting        | Effect |
        |------------------------|---------------|
        | `h_pyramid_sentry.init` | A dict of any [options understood by `sentry_sdk.init()`](https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/configuration/?platform=javascript#common-options) |
        | `h_pyramid_sentry.filters` | A list of functions to apply as filters |
        | `h_pyramid_sentry.retry_support` | Enable retry detection and filtering |
        
        As per the [Sentry docs](https://docs.sentry.io/error-reporting/configuration/?platform=python#dsn), the
        environment variable `SENTRY_DSN` will be automatically read if set, although this can
        also be passed along with any other Sentry SDK options via `h_pyramid_sentry.init`.
