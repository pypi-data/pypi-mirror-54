EagerPy
=======

EagerPy is a thin wrapper around **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow Eager** that unifies their interface and thus allows writing code that works with both.

Warning: this is work in progress; the tests should run through just fine, but lot's of features are still missing. Let me know if this project is useful to you and which features are needed.
