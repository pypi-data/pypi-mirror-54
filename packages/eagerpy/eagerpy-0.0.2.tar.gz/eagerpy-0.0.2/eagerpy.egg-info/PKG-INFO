        EagerPy
        =======
        
        EagerPy is a thin wrapper around **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow Eager** that unifies their interface and thus allows writing code that works with both.
        
        Warning: this is work in progress; the tests should run through just fine, but lot's of features are still missing. Let me know if this project is useful to you and which features are needed.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install eagerpy
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           import eagerpy as ep
        
           import torch
           x = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])
           x = ep.PyTorchTensor(x)
        
           import tensorflow as tf
           x = tf.constant([1., 2., 3.])
           x = ep.TensorFlowTensor(x)
        
           # In both cases, the resulting EagerPy tensor provides the same
           # interface and a library build on top of the interface provided
           # by EagerPy will work with both PyTorch and TensorFlow tensors.
        
           # EagerPy tensors provide a lot of functionality through methods, e.g.
           x.sum()
           x.sqrt()
           x.clip(0, 1)
        
           # but EagerPy also provides them as functions, e.g.
           ep.sum(x)
           ep.sqrt(x)
           ep.clip(x, 0, 1)
           ep.uniform((3, 3), low=-1., high=1.)
