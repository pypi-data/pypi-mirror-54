Veusz 3.1
---------
https://veusz.github.io

Veusz is a 2D and 3D scientific plotting package.  It is designed to
produce publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 3.1:
 Improvements:
  * Do not print or export hidden pages
  * Allow expressions in dataset of contour widget
  * Allow widgets to be excluded in key (thanks to Alexander Book)
  * Make bezier line better fit data

 Bug fixes:
  * Compilation fix for PyQt>=5.12 (thanks to Dimitry Shachnev)
  * Ensure fit settings are sorted in output file
  * Fix crash in contour labelling
  * Fix 3D axis crash bug
  * Fix problem with broken axis with null-sized regions
  * Fix issue with 0-sized images in image widget
  * Fix function widget crash with certain plotting range
  * Fix for axis crash with large magnitude ranges
  * Fix CSV importing issues for 2D and ND data
  * Fix zero division error in 2D import
  * Fix crash on importing HDF5 files with variable length text
  * Catch issue with zero range axes
  * Fix crash is using set in dataset expression
  * Fix crash when moving line coordinates
  * Remove deprecation warnings when compiling with recent Qt versions

Changes in 3.0.1:
 * Change in build system to use qmake to find Qt locations. This is to fix
   the build inside Anaconda. Also Qt and sip parameters can now be given
   as environment variables.
 * Fix problem when picking points with too many non-finite values
 * Change default SVG export DPI to 96 to match inkscape and provide
   option in dialog to choose export DPI
 * Allow %PAGE% and %PAGENAME% in export filename for single page output
 * Fix failing fitting due to iminuit differences
 * Fix crash if both ends of part of broken axis widget are the same for
   EMF exporting
 * Update to Qt 5.11.1 and update PyQt and sip in Windows binary
 * Build Mac and Linux binaries with EMF export

Changes in 3.0:
 * New 3D support for plotting points, functions, surfaces and volumes
 * Add --export-option parameter for command line exporting control
 * Add templates in preferences for exported file names, add %PAGE00% and
   %PAGE000% options for zero-prefixed page numbers, and change %PAGENUM%
   to %PAGE%
 * In export dialog allow user to specify arbitrary pages to export
 * Change miter limit for lines, which fixes some problems when exporting
   arrow to PDFs
 * Use flat cap on lines with arrows, to avoid line showing through head
 * Support datetime64 and string/unicode characters in npy/npz import
 * Add \hat LaTeX support

  * Data can be captured from external sources
 Extending:
  * Use as a Python module
  * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:
  * Data filtering and manipulation
  * Data picker
  * Interactive tutorial
  * Multithreaded rendering
