# pubg-reports
A Python-based Discord bot that tracks users from a given server in PUBG to automatically send their post-match stats to a pre-specified Discord channel.

## Prerequisites
* **Python 3.5.3 or higher is required**
* **PUBG API Key**
    * [Get yours here](https://developer.pubg.com/)
* **Discord API key**
    * A Discord application needs to be created in order to create a bot, [you can create a new Discord application here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
    * There are two keys for Discord, please disregard the client key and use the bot key
    * [A useful guide on how to create a bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#discord-intro)
* **Discord server & channel IDs**
    * The channel IDs are going to be used by the bot to
        1. Register new users
        2. Send reports for solo, duo and squad PUBG rounds
    * To acquire an ID for a given channel, please enabled developer mode in your Discord user settings, then simply right click a channel and there will be an option to **copy ID**

## Known Issues

* The bot supports up to one Discord server. There are plans to expand the capabilities of the bot to support multi servers.
