Ansible 2.6 "Heartbreaker" Release Notes
========================================

v2.6.20
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2019-10-17
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Bugfixes
--------

- **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14846 - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials in log files.  inventory/aws_ec2.py, inventory/aws_rds.py, lookup/aws_account_attribute.py, and lookup/aws_secret.py, lookup/aws_ssm.py use the boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level DEBUG.  If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG_PATH to a value) Ansible would set the global log level to DEBUG.  This was inherited by boto and would then log boto credentials to the file specified by LOG_PATH.  This did not affect aws ansible modules as those are executed in a separate process.  This has been fixed by switching to log level INFO
- **security issue** - Convert CLI provided passwords to text initially, to prevent unsafe context being lost when converting from bytes->text during post processing of PlayContext. This prevents CLI provided passwords from being incorrectly templated (CVE-2019-14856)

- **security issue** - properly hide parameters marked with ``no_log`` in suboptions when invalid parameters are passed to the module (CVE-2019-14858)

- PLUGIN_FILTERS_CFG - Ensure that the value is treated as type=path, and that we use the standard section of ``defaults`` instead of ``default`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45994)
- The patch fixing the regression of no longer preferring matching security groups in the same VPC https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45787 (which was also backported to 2.6) broke EC2-Classic accounts. https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/46242 removes the assumption that security groups must be in a VPC.
- azure_rm_deployment - fixed regression that prevents resource group from being created (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/45941)
- chroot connection - Support empty files with copying to target (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/36725)

- docker_container - Makes ``blkio_weight``, ``cpuset_mems``, ``dns_opts`` and ``uts`` options actually work.
- ec2_group - Sanitize the ingress and egress rules before operating on them by flattening any lists within lists describing the target CIDR(s) into a list of strings. Prior to Ansible 2.6 the ec2_group module accepted a list of strings, a list of lists, or a combination of strings and lists within a list. https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45594
- ec2_group - There can be multiple security groups with the same name in different VPCs. Prior to 2.6 if a target group name was provided, the group matching the name and VPC had highest precedence. Restore this behavior by updated the dictionary with the groups matching the VPC last.
- fetch_url did not always return lower-case header names in case of HTTP errors (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45628).
- fix nxos_facts indefinite hang for text based output (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45845).

However, if the user explicitly specifies that the config file should be used via the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable then Ansible would honor that but still print out the warning message.  This has been fixed so that Ansible honors the user's explicit wishes and does not print a warning message in that circumstance.

Bugfixes
--------

- **Security Fix** - avoid loading host/group vars from cwd when not specifying a playbook or playbook base dir
- **Security Fix** - avoid using ansible.cfg in a world writable dir.
- Fix junos_config confirm commit timeout issue (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41527)

v2.6.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2018-06-28
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`_


Minor Changes
-------------

- Added an ``encoding`` option to the ``b64encode`` and ``b64decode`` filters to specify the encoding of the string that is base64 encoded.
- PowerShell modules that use Convert-ToSID in Ansible.ModuleUtils.SID.psm1 like win_user_right now accept an actual SID as an input string. This means any local or domain accounts that are named like a SID need to be prefixed with the domain, hostname, or . to ensure it converts to that accounts SID https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/38502
- Raise AnsibleParserError which was missing previously
- The aws_ses_identity module supports check mode
- ``postgresql_user`` module changed ``encrypted=yes`` to be the default. This shouldn't break any current playbooks, the module will just store passwords hashed by default. This change was done because Postgres 10 dropped support for ``UNENCRYPTED`` passwords and because all versions since Postgres 7.2 support storing encrypted passwords.
- azure_rm_loadbalancer - add support for sku
- azure_rm_publicipaddress - add support for sku
- cloudflare_dns module - Removed restriction from protocol to allow other protocols than tcp and udp to be specified.
- command module - Added argv option to allow command to be specified as a list vs. a string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/19392)
- gem - add ability to specify a custom directory for installing gems (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38195)
- import/include - Cache task_vars to speed up IncludedFile.process_include_results (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39026)
- postgresql_user module - Changed encrypted=yes to be the default. This shouldn't break any current playbooks, the module will just store passwords hashed by default. This change was done because Postgres 10 dropped support for UNENCRYPTED passwords and because all versions since Postgres 7.2 support storing encrypted passwords.
- vmware_target_canonical_facts module - The target_id parameter is an optional parameter.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- nxos_igmp_interface module - The oif_prefix and oif_source properties are deprecated. Use the oif_ps parameter with a dictionary of prefix and source to values instead.

Removed Features (previously deprecated)

- removed the deprecated always_run task option, please use ``check_mode: no`` instead
- win_chocolatey - removed deprecated upgrade option and choco_* output return values

Bugfixes
--------

- **Security Fix** - Some connection exceptions would cause no_log specified on a task to be ignored.  If this happened, the task information, including any private information could have been displayed to stdout and (if enabled, not the default) logged to a log file specified in ansible.cfg's log_path. Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from ansible runs to a log file may have stored that private information onto disk that way as well. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41414)
- Changed the admin_users config option to not include "admin" by default as admin is frequently used for a non-privileged account  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41164)
- Changed the output to "text" for "show vrf" command as default "json" output format with respect to "eapi" transport was failing (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41470)
- Document mode=preserve for both the copy and template module
- Fix added for Digital Ocean Volumes API change causing Ansible to recieve an unexpected value in the response. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41431)
- Fix an encoding issue when parsing the examples from a plugins' documentation
- Fix iosxr_config module to handle route-policy, community-set, prefix-set, as-path-set and rd-set blocks. All these blocks are part of route-policy language of iosxr.
- Fix mode=preserve with remote_src=True for the copy module
- Implement mode=preserve for the template module
- The yaml callback plugin now allows non-ascii characters to be displayed.
- Various grafana_* modules - Port away from the deprecated b64encodestring function to the b64encode function instead. https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38388
- added missing 'raise' to exception definition https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41690
- allow custom endpoints to be used in the aws_s3 module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36832)
- allow set_options to be called multiple times https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41913
- ansible-doc - fixed traceback on missing plugins (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41167)
- cast the device_mapping volume size to an int in the ec2_ami module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40938)
- copy - fixed copy to only follow symlinks for files in the non-recursive case
- copy module - The copy module was attempting to change the mode of files for remote_src=True even if mode was not set as a parameter.  This failed on filesystems which do not have permission bits (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40099)
- copy module - fixed recursive copy with relative paths (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40166)
- correct debug display for all cases https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41331

- dynamic includes - Fix IncludedFile comparison for free strategy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37083)
- dynamic includes - Improved performance by fixing re-parenting on copy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38747)
- dynamic includes - Use the copied and merged task for calculating task vars (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39762)
- file - fixed the default follow behaviour of file to be true
- file module - Eliminate an error if we're asked to remove a file but something removes it while we are processing the request (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39466)
- file module - Fix error when recursively assigning permissions and a symlink to a nonexistent file is present in the directory tree (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39456)
- file module - Fix error when running a task which assures a symlink to a nonexistent file exists for the second and subsequent times (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39558)
- file module - The file module allowed the user to specify src as a parameter when state was not link or hard.  This is documented as only applying to state=link or state=hard but in previous Ansible, this could have an effect in rare cornercases.  For instance, "ansible -m file -a 'state=directory path=/tmp src=/var/lib'" would create /tmp/lib.  This has been disabled and a warning emitted (will change to an error in Ansible-2.10).
- file module - The touch subcommand had its diff output broken during the 2.6.x development cycle.  This is now fixed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41755)

- selinux - correct check mode behavior to report same changes as normal mode (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40721)
- spwd - With python 3.6 spwd.getspnam returns PermissionError instead of KeyError if user does not have privileges (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39472)
- synchronize - Ensure the local connection created by synchronize uses _remote_is_local=True, which causes ActionBase to build a local tmpdir (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40833)
- template - Fix for encoding issues when a template path contains non-ascii characters and using the template path in ansible_managed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/27262)
