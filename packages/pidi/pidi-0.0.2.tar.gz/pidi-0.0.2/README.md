`pidi` is a plugin-compatible fork of `bum`, a daemon that downloads album art for songs playing in `mpd`/`mopidy` and displays them in a little window. 

`pidi` isn't as lightweight as `bum`, but supports displaying track information to a variety of output devices including a 240x240 ST7789 LCD. `pidi` is intended for use with the Raspberry Pi, but can be used on other systems with the appropriate display plugins.

`pidi` uses [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) to source and download cover art, if an album is missing its cover art you can easily create an account and fill in the data yourself. `pidi` outputs a `release-id` which you can use to find the exact entry on musicbrainz.

Note: `pidi` is meant to be used with files that don't have embedded album art (eg: `mopidy-spotify`).
