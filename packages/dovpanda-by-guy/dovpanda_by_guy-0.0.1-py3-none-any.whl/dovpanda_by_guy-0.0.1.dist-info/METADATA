## Directions OVer PANDAs

Directions are hints and tips for using pandas in an analysis environment.
dovpanda is an overlay for working with pandas in an analysis environment.    
If you think your task is common enough, it probably is, and Pandas probably has a built-in solution.
dovpanda is an overlay module that tries to understand what you are trying to do with your data, and help you
find easier ways to write your code.

## Usage
### Hints
The basic usage of `dovpanda` is its hints mechanism, which is very easy and out-of-the-box. Just import it after you import pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
import dovpanda
```     
This is it. From now on you can expect `dovpanda` to come with helpful hints while you are writing you code.

### Example
```python
In [3]: df = pd.DataFrame({'a':list('xxyy'),'b':[40,50,60,70], 'time':['18:02','18:45','20:12','21:50']})
   ...: df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df.time)
   ...: df['hour'] = df.time.dt.hour

In [4]: df.groupby('hour').b.sum()
===== Seems like you are grouping by a column named 'hour', consider setting the your
time column as index and then use df.resample('h') =====
Out[4]:
hour
18    90
20    60
21    70
Name: b, dtype: int64
```

### Notebook Support
Running `dovpanda` in a notebook environment will display rendered dismissable html.

## Advanced Usage
### Random Tips
`dovpanda.tip()` will give you a random `pandas` tip.

### Change Display
use `dovpanda.set_output` if you want to change output.

```python
In [14]: dovpanda.set_output('display')

In [15]: df.iterrows()
===== iterrows is not recommended, and in the majority of cases will have better alternatives =====
Out[15]: <generator object DataFrame.iterrows at 0x110fe4318>

In [16]: dovpanda.set_output('print')

In [17]: df.iterrows()
iterrows is not recommended, and in the majority of cases will have better alternatives
Out[17]: <generator object DataFrame.iterrows at 0x112c408b8>

In [18]: dovpanda.set_output('warning')

In [19]: df.iterrows()
WARNING:dovpanda:iterrows is not recommended, and in the majority of cases will have better alternatives
Out[19]: <generator object DataFrame.iterrows at 0x110ee7e58>

In [20]: dovpanda.set_output('off')

In [21]: df.iterrows()
Out[21]: <generator object DataFrame.iterrows at 0x1047c4d68>```
