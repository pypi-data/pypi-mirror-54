        # RuneS-DB
        
        RuneS-DB is a platform where [results from different projects on runic inscriptions](https://www.runesdb.eu/project/data-sources/) 
        are combined.
        
        This repository is completely independent from RuneS-DB.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Works for Python 3.6 and above.
        
        ```
        $ pip install runesdb
        ```
        
        ## Sources
        
        The data is available [here](http://www.runesdb.eu/) where you can export results of a query by clicking on a small 
        button whose id is "butDownloadExcelModal" (I note it here because I needed time to find it!). 
        
        When you download data, you get this note:
        > The rights to the data are held by the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities and are subject to the CC-BY- SA law. The RuneS research units Göttingen, Eichstätt-München and Kiel were involved in the generation of the data. RuneS-DB contains data from the Kiel Runenprojekt, the Danish database runer.ku.dk and the Samnordisk runtextdatabas/Rundata accessible under the Open Database License (ODbL). Please also note the additional information on other origin of the data provided under the label sources .
        
        If you confirm by clicking on "Download data", you will get a file named "runes_data.csv". 
        
        ## Code
        
        User `reader.py` just to read your data. `visualize.py` provides a basic example on how to look at data according 
        to estimated time of creation of runic inscriptions;
