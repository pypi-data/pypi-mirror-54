Description: # BiggerQuery &mdash; The Python framework for BigQuery
        
        Tired of the limiting BigQuery console? Open your Jupyter notebook and start working with BigQuery using Python!
        
        BiggerQuery lets you:
        * Work with BigQuery using Python code.
        * Create a workflow that you can automatically convert to an Airflow DAG.
        * Implement a configurable environment for your workflows.
        * Organize your data processing.
        * Create a workflow from a Jupyter notebook.
        * Work with BigQuery from any other environment.
        * Run and schedule the Apache-Beam pipelines.
        * Mix BigQuery, Python and Apache-Beam in your workflows.
        
        BiggerQuery scales to your needs. It's very easy to start making queries and creating workflows. If needed, 
        BiggerQuery lets you implement complex stuff (the Allegro experimentation platform was created using the BiggerQuery framework).
