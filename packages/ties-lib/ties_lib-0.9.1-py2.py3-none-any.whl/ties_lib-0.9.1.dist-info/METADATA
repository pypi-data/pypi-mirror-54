Triage Import Export Schema (TIES)
**********************************

Overview
========

The Triage Import Export Schema (TIES) specifies a data interchange format for bidirectional sharing of data. The schema
captures object items, relationships, and assertion information via a generic and flexible approach.

At its highest level, it consists of:

* An array of exported multimedia object items (videos, images, documents) and associated metadata, not including the raw multimedia data
* An array of groups of related object items
* An array of analyst annotations relating to object items included in the export
* An array of supplemental descriptions relating to object items included in the export
* Relationships between object items, annotations, and supplemental descriptions
* An array of key/value pairs containing user-defined metadata
