Description: # Jupyter Notebook Server Shim
        
        **A package that provides a simple transition away from Jupyter Notebook to Jupyter Server.**
        
        This library allows you to install both [jupyter/notebook](http://localhost:8888/tree) and a Jupyter Notebook Server Extension side-by-side (and any other Jupyter Server Frontend).
        
        This helps projects like JupyterLab and nteract_on_jupyter transition from jupyter/notebook to jupyter/jupyter_server for the core Jupyter Tornado Server.

        ```
