Foreword

Protean has two broad goals in mind:

**1. Isolate Business logic from the underlying technology and closely model it after the Domain**

Developers should be able to express infrastructure-free domain logic in a clear and concise way, without worrying about underlying technology implementation. The framework should be pragmatic enough, though, and allow usage of exclusive technology features where possible for performance or aesthetics. Developers can delay critical decisions until the last possible moment and switch between technologies painlessly if and when the time does come.

**2. Support Operations and Infrastructure maintenance**

Developers should be able to deploy and scale applications in realtime on most popular IaaS platforms as well as private data centers. All infrastructure components, like databases, API frameworks, message brokers and cache, are maintained outside the application and plugged into the framework during runtime.
