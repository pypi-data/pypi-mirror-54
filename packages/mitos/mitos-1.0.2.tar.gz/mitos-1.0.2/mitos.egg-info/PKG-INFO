Description: Thes are the mitogenome related sources including MITOS and other (more or less) helpful tools. Note that some of the tools are unfinished and not in a production state.

        Installation
        ============
        
        There are three ways to install. Prefered is the installation via conda since this also takes care of non-python requirements of the main mitos script.
        
        1. via conda: `conda install mitos -c bioconda -m -n mitos`
        2. via pip: `pip install mitos`
        3. manual: pip -r requirements.txt
        
        For the non-python requirements see README.MITOS.
        
        MITOS
        =====
        
        * runmitos.py: standalone CLI MITOS
        
        see also `mitos.py --help` README.MITOS
        
        
        genbank file handling
        =====================
        
        * refseqsplit:
            - splits a file consisting of concatenated gb files into single genbank files
            - its possible to apply filters (taxonomy, prefix)
        
        skewness related programs
        =========================
        
        * skew:
        	compute skewness values for a gene of given genbank files
        * skewcum:
        	compute cumulative skewness for given genbank files
        * skewsvm:
        	do svm classification of skewness values .. and try to relate misclassifications to rearrangements
        
        MISC
        ====
        
        * gcpp
        	- pretty print and compare genetic code
