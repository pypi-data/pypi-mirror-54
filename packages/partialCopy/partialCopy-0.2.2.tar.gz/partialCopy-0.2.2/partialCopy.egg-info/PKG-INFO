Description: # partialCopy
        A tool to copy big data to multiple smaller disks
        
        ## Motivation
        
        As the storage becomes larger in big projects, we need to a tool to break large folders (100 TBs) to smaller chunks to be allow to migrate to another location or storing it on tapes.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```sudo pip install partialCopy```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        pcp [-h] [-lg LOG] [-ls LST] [-ns NO_SCAN] [-rs RSYNC] src dest
        
        positional arguments:
          src                   Source Directory
          dest                  Dest Mountpoint
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -lg LOG, --log LOG    Log File to use
          -ls LST, --lst LST    List File to use
          -ns, --no-scan        Don't rescan the folder, this needs a previous run
          -rs RSYNC, --rsync RSYNC         Extra rsync parameters
        ```
        
        ## Notes
        
        * A log file will be written as $src/.pcp_log (by default)
        * A list file will be written as $src/.pcp_lst (by default)
        * The conf file is /etc/pcp.cfg
        * A user can has his own config as ~/.pcp.cfg
        * When the dest is full, the exit code is -125
