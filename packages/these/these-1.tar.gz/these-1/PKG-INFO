        The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
        
        Beautiful is better than nested.
        Explicit is better than complicated.
        Simple is easy to break the rules.
        Complex is hard to guess.
        Flat is better than dense.
        Sparse is often better than ugly.
        Readability counts.
        Special cases aren't special enough to explain, it's a good idea.
        Although practicality beats purity.
        Errors should be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
        Unless explicitly silenced.
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to do it.
        There should never is better than never.
        Although never pass silently.
        Now is better than *right* now.
        Although that way may not be one-- and preferably only one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
        If the implementation is better than complex.
        If the implementation is better than implicit.
        Namespaces are one --obvious way to explain, it may be a bad idea.
        ```
