Description: # S3Watcher
        
        A daemon to cache the object listings for [AWS
        S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets. If you have a very large
        bucket, then listing the entire bucket can take a long time. The daemon
        can also watch an [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) queue for changes
        in the bucket.
