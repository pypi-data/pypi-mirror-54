Description: django-scribbler
        ===================
        
        django-scribbler is an application for managing snippets of text for a Django website.
        Similar projects include django-flatblocks, django-chunks and django-pagelets. This
        project attempts to take some of the best concepts from those previous projects as
        well as focus on giving the users instant feedback inspired by Bret Victor's
        `Inventing on Principle <http://vimeo.com/36579366>`_ talk.
