        An unofficial Python wrapper for indodax.com API with support for async i/o
        
        [Original API documentation](https://indodax.com/downloads/INDODAXCOM-API-DOCUMENTATION.pdf)
        
        ## Public API
        Indodax provides 4 public endpoint that can be accessed by the public. This library will provide those 4 endpoints in the `pyndodax.public` module, which consisted of:
        
        * Get current price of all markets (`aio_get_all_tickers()`) 
        * Get current price of a given market (`aio_get_ticker(pair)`)
        * Get last few trade history of a given market (`aio_get_trades(pair)`)
        * Get bids and asks of a given market (`aio_get_depth(pair)`)
        
        You can describe a trade pair with `Pair`, custom enum type that can be accessed at `pyndodax.pair`. If you want to pick a currency that is traded against IDR, just refer it with the currency symbol, all uppercase. For BTC traded currencies, add `_BTC` as a postfix. e.g.:
        * btc-idr is `Pair.BTC`
        * bat-idr is `Pair.BAT`
        * eth-btc is `Pair.ETH_BTC`
        * etc.
