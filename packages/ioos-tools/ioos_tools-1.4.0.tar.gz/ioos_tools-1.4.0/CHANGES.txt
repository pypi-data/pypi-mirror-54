Version 1.0.0

* First oficial release

Version 0.5.0

* Faster `is_model`. (Bypass iris cube creation.)
* Using folium `v0.2.0` for maps.
* Re-incorporated tardis.py functions.
* Fixed pandas-syntax bug.
* No longer hard-code the log name in `start_log`.

Version 0.4.1

  `within` searches.

Version 0.4.0

* Simpler `fes_date_filter()`.
* Update to latest pandas syntax.
* Fix `get_coops_metadata()` to comply with latest Coops SensorML changes.

Version 0.3.0

* Added a new module for Quality Assurance and Quality Control `qaqc.py`:
  `has_time_gaps()`, `is_monotonically_increasing()`, `is_flatline()`,
  `is_spike()`, `threshold_series()`, `filter_spikes()`, and `tukey53H()`.
* Added `is_station()` for faster checks than`is_model()`.
* Several bug fixes (See https://github.com/ocefpaf/boston_light_swim/issues/5)
* Deprecate `sos_request()` in favor of `collector2table()` to get a list of
  available stations in a `pyoos` `collector` object.
* Renamed `coops2df` to the more general `pyoos2df`
  (downloads both Coops and NDBC).

Version 0.2.6

* Parse HTML station names strings.
* Added `fetch_range()`, `show_qr()`,`get_nbviewer()`, `save_html()`,

* Added ioos module with system-test functions.
* Replaced `get_coops_longName()` with `get_coops_metadata()`
* Added Root Mean Squared Error`rmse()` and all of sklearn.metrics
  (`mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, `median_absolute_error`,
  `r2_score`, `explained_variance_score`).

Version 0.2.4

* Lazy import SciPy.
* Factored `iris_utis.py` out of the module.
* Fixed a bug in `ndbc2df()`.

Version 0.2.3

  are satellite data and not numerical models.

Version 0.2.2

* In-lining folium maps HTML because embed HTML fails with sub-directories.
* Removed `standardize_fill_value()` (See
