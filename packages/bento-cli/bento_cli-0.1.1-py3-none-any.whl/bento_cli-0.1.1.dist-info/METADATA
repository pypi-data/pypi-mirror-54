# Bento

Bento finds the bugs that matter to you.

Bento automatically tailors linters and static analysis with sane defaults on a per-project basis, letting you focus on writing code rather than configuring tools. Bento is free, fully-featured, and you can run Bento on as many projects as you like.

## Installation

### Requirements

Bento is supported on macOS Mojave (10.14) and Ubuntu 18.04+, and requires Python version 3.6 or later and pip3. For JS projects, bento requires Node.js with version recommended in [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-6.0.0.md#-nodejs-6-is-no-longer-supported).

- Node.js 8 (8.10.0 and above)
- Node.js 10 (10.13.0 and above)
- Anything above Node.js 11.10.1

Bento supports npm-packaged JavaScript and Python, and is ideal for monorepos.

### Installing Bento

Run

```
pip3 install bento-cli
```

## Usage

The workflow for Bento is:

1. Initialize Bento
2. Run Bento checks on your source code
3. Fix issues or archive unnecessary warning and errors
4. Disable undesired checks
5. Add Bento to git pre-commit hooks
6. Add Bento to the CI pipeline (e.g., CircleCI)

### Initialize Bento for a project:

To set up for a project, navigate to the root of your project (e.g., where your `.git` directory is located).

Then run:

```
bento init
```

This will install and configure Bento for your project.

### For git

Add this to your `.gitignore`:

```
.bento
```

### Analyze your source code

To trigger Bento to analyze your project, run:

```
bento check
```

### Archive outstanding issues

The `archive` command whitelists outstanding issues to fix later. This lets you continue coding with a clean slate without having to address all your tech debt as soon as you adopt a new tool. New issues introduced from this point forward will be reported by Bento until the next time you run the `archive` command.

```
bento archive
```

and commit the resulting `.bento-baseline.yml` file.

### Disable and enable individual checks

Enable/disable a specific check by running:

```
bento enable [OPTIONS] TOOL CHECK
```

or

```
bento disable [OPTIONS] TOOL CHECK
```

where:

- `TOOL` refers to the tool that includes the check, for example, `r2c.eslint`
- `CHECK` refers to the label for the check you want to enable, for example `no-console`

Example:

```
bento enable r2c.eslint no-console
```

You can find the tool and check names in the output of `bento check`. Bento currently supports the following tools:

| Language   | Supported Tools |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Python     | Bandit, Flake8  |
| JavaScript | ESLint          |

If there are tools you'd like us to add, please let us know by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento/issues/new).

### Install Bento as a pre-commit hook

Bento can install itself as a pre-commit hook, so it runs before each commit and blocks on failures.

To install bento as a pre-commit hook, simply run:

```
bento install-hook
```
