    ModelZooConnection class. This class will be the main client API for connecting to a ModelZoo instance, whether it be a local or external one.
    This class manages authentication, and features several bound methods to aid the user in creation and manipulation of users and models.

    Attributes
    ----------
    address : Optional[string]
        This is the address of the ModelZoo instance to connect to.
    email : Optional[string]
        The email with which to authenticate to the ModelZoo instance.
        password : Optional[string]: The password with which to authenticate to the ModelZoo instance.
    conn : GRPC Channel
        The connection to the ModelZoo instance. The connect() method must be called to instantiate this.
            Before this is instantiated, most methods will fail.
    token : string
        The token to use for rate limiting and potentially access control in the future.
    conn_error : ModelZooConnectionException
        A shorthand for the connection exception to be raised whenever a method is called before a connection
            to the ModelZoo instance has been instantiated.
    authenticated : bool
        Flag that indicates whether or not user has authenticated. Can be used to block access to creation or manipulation of models.
