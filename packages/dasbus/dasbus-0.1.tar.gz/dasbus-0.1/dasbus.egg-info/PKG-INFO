Description: # dasbus
        This DBus library is written in Python 3, based on GLib and inspired by pydbus.
        
        The code used to be part of the [Anaconda Installer](https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda)
        project. It was based on the [pydbus](https://github.com/LEW21/pydbus) library, but we replaced
        it with our own solution because of its inactivity. The dasbus library is a result of this effort.
