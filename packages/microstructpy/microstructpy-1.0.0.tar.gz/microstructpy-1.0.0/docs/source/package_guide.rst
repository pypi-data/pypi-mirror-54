Python Package Guide
====================

The python package for MicroStructPy includes the following classes::

    microstructpy
    ├─ geometry
    │  ├─ Box
    │  ├─ Cube
    │  ├─ Circle
    │  ├─ Ellipse
    │  ├─ Ellipsoid
    │  ├─ Rectangle
    │  ├─ Square
    │  └─ Sphere
    ├─ seeding
    │  ├─ Seed
    │  └─ SeedList
    └─ meshing
       ├─ PolyMesh
       └─ TriMesh

Seeds are given a geometry and a material number,
SeedLists are lists of Seeds,
the PolyMesh can be created from a SeedList,
and finally the TriMesh can be created from a PolyMesh.
This is the flow of information built into the MicroStructPy command line
interface (CLI).
Custom algorithms for seeding or meshing can be implemented using the classes
above and a few key methods.

**The following describes the 3-step process of generating a microstructure
mesh in MicroStructPy**, including the relevant classes and methods.
For a complete list of MicroStructPy classes, visit the
:any:`API <microstructpy>` page.
Visit the :ref:`Examples <package_examples>` page for examples using the
API.

0. List of Seed Geometries
--------------------------

The list of seed geometries is a :class:`.SeedList`.
The SeedList can be created from a list of :class:`.Seed` instances, which
each contain a geometry and a phase.

A SeedList can also be generated from a list of material phase dictionaries
and a total seed volume using the :meth:`.SeedList.from_info` class method.
The default seed volume is the volume of the domain.
For more information on how to format the phase information, see the
:ref:`phase_dict_guide` below.

One convenience function is :meth:`.Seed.factory`, which takes in a
geometry name and keyword arguments and returns a Seed with that geometry.


1. Pack Geometries into Domain
------------------------------

The standard domain is a geometry from the :any:`microstructpy.geometry`.
To pack the geometries into the domain, the centers of the seeds are specified
such that there is a tolerable about of overlap with other seeds, if any.

The standard method for positioning seeds in a domain is
:meth:`.SeedList.position`.
This function updates the :any:`Seed.position` property of each Seed in the
SeedList.
The centers of all the seeds are within the domain geometry.


2. Tessellate the Domain
------------------------

A tessellation of the domain divides its interior into polygonal/polyhedral
cells with no overlap or gaps between them.
This tessellation is stored in a :class:`.PolyMesh` class.
The default method for creating a PolyMesh from a positioned list of seeds and
a domain is :meth:`.PolyMesh.from_seeds`.
This method creates a Voronoi-Laguerre diagram using the `Voro++`_ package.
Note that the only supported 3D domains are cubes and boxes.


3. Unstructured Meshing
-----------------------

Unstructured (triangular or tetrahedral) meshes can be used in finite
element software to analyze the behavior of the microstructure.
Their data are contained in the :class:`.TriMesh` class.
This mesh can be created from a polygonal tessellation using the
:meth:`.TriMesh.from_polymesh` method.
The mesh can be output to several different file formats.

The unstructured meshes are generated using `Triangle`_ in 2D, `TetGen`_ in 3D,
and `MeshPy`_ is the wrapper.


File I/O
--------

There are file read and write functions associated with each of the classes
listed above.

The read methods are:

* :meth:`.SeedList.from_file`
* :meth:`.PolyMesh.from_file`
* :meth:`.TriMesh.from_file`

The write methods are:

* :meth:`.SeedList.write`
* :meth:`.PolyMesh.write`
* :meth:`.TriMesh.write`

The read functions currently only support reading cache text files.
The SeedList only writes to cache text files, while PolyMesh and TriMesh can
output to several file formats.

Plotting
--------

The SeedList, PolyMesh, and TriMesh classes have the following plotting
methods:

* :meth:`.SeedList.plot`
* :meth:`.SeedList.plot_breakdown`
* :meth:`.PolyMesh.plot`
* :meth:`.PolyMesh.plot_facet`
* :meth:`.TriMesh.plot`


These functions operate like the matplotlib ``plt.plot`` function in that
they just plot to the current figure.
You still need to add ``plt.axis('equal')``, ``plt.show()``, etc to format and
view the plots.


.. _phase_dict_guide:

Phase Dictionaries
------------------

Functions with phase information input require a list of dictionaries, one for
each material phase.
The dictionaries should be organized in a manner similar to the example below.

.. code-block:: python

       phase = {
              'name': 'Example Phase',
              'color': 'blue',
              'material_type': 'crystalline',
              'fraction': 0.5,
              'max_volume': 0.1,
              'shape': 'ellipse',
              'size': 1.2,
              'aspect_ratio': 2
       }

The dictionary contains both data about the phase as a whole, such as its
volume fraction and material type, and about the individual grains.
The keywords ``size`` and ``aspect_ratio`` are keyword arguments for defining
an :class:`.Ellipse`, so those are passed through to the Ellipse class when
creating the seeds.
For a non-uniform size (or aspect ratio) distribution, replace the constant
value with a `SciPy statistical distribution`_.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

       import scipy.stats
       size_dist = scipy.stats.uniform(loc=1, scale=0.4)
       phase['size'] = size_dist

The ``max_volume`` option allows for maximum element volume controls to be
phase-specific.
