Getting Started
===============

This page covers topics for new users to get started using MicroStructPy.

Download & Installation
-----------------------

To install MicroStructPy, download it from PyPI using::

    pip install microstructpy

If there is an error with the install, try to install ``pybind11`` first.
You may need to add the ``--user`` flag, depending on your permissions.
This installs both the ``microstructpy`` Python package and the
``microstructpy`` command line interface (CLI).

To verify installation of the package, run ``python`` and enter the command::

    >>> import microstructpy

If the import succeeds without an error message, then MicroStructPy installed
successfully.

To verify that the command line interface has been installed,
run ``microstructpy --help`` to see if the man page is printed.
If it is not, then the install location may not be in your PATH variable.
The most likely install location is ``~/.local/bin`` for Mac or Linux machines.
For Windows, it may be in a path similar to
``~\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python36\Scripts\``.

From Source
+++++++++++

To install from source, navigate to the `GitHub repository`_ to clone or
download the latest release.
Unzip the source if necessary and change directories to the top-level folder.
From this folder, run the command::

    pip install -e .

.. note::
    If the install fails and the last several error messages reference
    ``pybind11``, run ``pip install pybind11`` first then install MicroStructPy.

Running Demonstrations
----------------------

MicroStructPy comes with several demonstrations to familiarize users with its
capabilities and options.
A demonstration can be run from the command line by::

    microstructpy --demo=docs_banner.xml

When a demo is run, the XML input file is copied to the current working
directory.
To see a full list of available demos, visit the :ref:`examples_page` page.


Using the Python Package
------------------------

The MicrostructPy package contains several classes and users can customize
their workflows depending on their needs. For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/standard_voronoi.py

The commands above create a Voronoi diagram with 50 random seed points:

.. figure:: ../../examples/standard_voronoi/voronoi_diagram.png
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :alt: Voronoi diagram with 50 random seed points

    Plot resulting from the Python script above.

More information about this example is available on the :ref:`ex_std_voro`
page.
The :ref:`package_guide` page has more details on writing scripts with the
package and the standard data flow.
