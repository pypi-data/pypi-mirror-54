Description: 
        PQk-means [Matsui, Ogaki, Yamasaki, and Aizawa, ACMMM 17] is a Python library for efficient clustering of large-scale data. By first compressing input vectors into short product-quantized (PQ) codes, PQk-means achieves fast and memory-efficient clustering, even for high-dimensional vectors. Similar to k-means, PQk-means repeats the assignment and update steps, both of which can be performed in the PQ-code domain.
        For a comparison, we provide the ITQ encoding for the binary conversion and Binary k-means [Gong+, CVPR 15] for the clustering of binary codes.
        The library is written in C++ for the main algorithm with wrappers for Python. All encoding/clustering codes are compatible with scikit-learn.
