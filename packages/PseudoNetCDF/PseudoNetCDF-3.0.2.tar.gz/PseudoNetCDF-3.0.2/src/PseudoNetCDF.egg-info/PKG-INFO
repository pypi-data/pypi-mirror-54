Description: NetCDF, NCO, and CDO are fantastic softwares that I use,
        emulate, and admire. The primary drawbacks are restrictions on which
        scientific data sources they will and won't work with, and what types
        of operations they will and won't do. PseudoNetCDF was originally just
        a NetCDF-like interface for many data formats, but has grown to include
        many functionalities from NCO and CDO. This is a platform independent,
        easy to install software to make scientific data manipulation easy.
