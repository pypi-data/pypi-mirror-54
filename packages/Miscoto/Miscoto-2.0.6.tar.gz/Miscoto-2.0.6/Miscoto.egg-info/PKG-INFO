Description: MiSCoTo is a Python3 tool to explore microbiomes and select minimal communities within them. It uses Answer Set Programming (ASP) to optimize community selection. Inputs: metabolic models, seeds (growth medium) and metabolic targets. Computations can be performed with a set of symbionts or a set of symbionts and a host. In the latter case, targets will be produced by the host, whereas in the former they will be produced by any member of the microbiome.
