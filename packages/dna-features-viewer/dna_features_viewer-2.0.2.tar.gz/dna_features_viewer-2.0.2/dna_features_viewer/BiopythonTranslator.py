class BiopythonTranslator:
    """A translator from SeqRecords to dna_features_viewer GraphicRecord.

    This can be subclassed to create custom "themes" (see the example
    ``custom_biopython_translator.py`` in the docs).

    This class is meant to be customized by subclassing and changing the
    methods (``compute_feature_label``, etc.) and/or the attributes
    (``default_feature_color`` etc).

    Attributes
    ----------

    default_feature_color = "#7245dc"
    graphic_record_parameters
      Dictionnary containing keyword arguments that will be passed to the
      (Circular)GraphicRecord constructor

    ignored_features_types
      A list or tuple of strings indicating all the feature types that should
      always be ignored (i.e. not included in the graphic record) by the
      translator

    max_label_length
      Number of characters above which the labels will be printed cut and
      ended with an ellipsis "â€¦". This is to prevent extra-long labels from
      polluting the whole plots.

    max_line_length
      Feature labels with a number of characters above this number will be
      wrapped on 2 or more lines.

    label_fields
      This list of strings provides the order in which the different
      attributes of a Genbank feature will be considered, when automatically
      determining the feature label. For instance if the list is
      ["label", "source", "locus_tag"] and a feature has no label but has a
      "source", the "source" will be displayed in the plots.

    Parameters
    ----------

    features_filters
      List of filters (some_biopython_feature) => True/False.
      Only features passing all the filters are kept.
      This only works if you haven't redefined ``compute_filtered_features``

    features_properties
      A function (feature)=> properties_dict
