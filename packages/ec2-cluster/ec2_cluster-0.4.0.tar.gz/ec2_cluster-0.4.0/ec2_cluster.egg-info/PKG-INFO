Description: # ec2-cluster
        
        Simple library and CLI to work with clusters of EC2 instances. Multi-purpose, but created to make deep learning distributed training infrastructure easier. 
        
        `ec2-cluster` is designed for simple distributed tasks where Kubernetes is overkill or where fast cluster spin up/down is crucial. It provides the ability to launch a cluster, to retrieve IP addresses for all nodes in the cluster, to delete the cluster and to execute commands on some or all of the instances. 
        
        Other benefits:
        - Resilient to EC2 capacity limits. If instances are not available, `ec2-cluster` will retry until the all nodes in the cluster are created or until the user-set timeout is reached.
        - Easy to quickly launch duplicate clusters for parallel training runs.
        - Can write orchestration logic that needs to be run when launching a cluster, e.g. enabling passwordless ssh between all instances for Horovod-based training

        ## Goals
        
        - Provide the minimal set of features to run distributed deep learning training jobs on EC2 instances.
        - Provide libraries, not a framework or platform.
        - Make cluster environments reproducible to allow for parallelization of experiments
        - Make cluster launches fast
        - Be resilient to EC2 capacity limitations
        - Encourage ephemeral infrastructure design
        - Focus on iterative, not disruptive, improvements on the common methodology of manually launching EC2 instances, ssh-ing to them, configuring environments by hand and running scripts
        
        ### Overview
        
        `ec2-cluster` can be consumed in two ways:
        
        - A CLI for launching, describing and deleting clusters. 
        - A python library for scripting.  
        
        This library has three main components:L
        - **infra**: creating cluster infrastructure
        - **orch**: orchestrating simple runtime cluster configuration (e.g. generate a hostfile with runtime IPs)
        - **control**: running commands on the cluster
