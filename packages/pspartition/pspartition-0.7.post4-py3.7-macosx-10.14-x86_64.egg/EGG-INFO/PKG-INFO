        # Python binding
        [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pspartition.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pspartition)
        ## How to build
        The binding uses `Cython`. 
        To package the library, use `python setup.py bdist_wheel`.
        Install the package by `pip install --user pspartition`. 
        Below is the pre-built binary packages:
        
        | Platform | py3.6 | py3.7 |
        | -------- | :---: | :---: |
        | Windows  |   T   |   T   |
        | MacOS    |   T   |   T   |
        | Linux    |   T   |   T   |
        
        ## Demo code
        ![](./example/example.png)
        
        ```Python
        import pspartition # classify the three data points shown in the above figure
        g = pspartion.PsPartition(3, [(0,1,1),(1,2,1),(0,2,5)]) # index started from zero, similarity is 5 for vertex 0 and 2
        g.run() # default to use psp_i algorithm to classify them
        print(g.get_critical_values()) # [2,5]
        print(g.get_partitions()) # get the result which has at least 2 categories, which is [0,1,0]
        ```
        
        
        
        
        ## ChangeLog
        
        - Version 0.2: expose `PSP` (C++) class, which is high customizable in python.
        - Version 0.3: expose `PyGraphPDT` (C++) class, which has similar API as `PyGraph` but different inner implementation.
        - Version 0.5: expose `run_psp_i`  for `InfoCluster`.
        - Version 0.7: change the python binding name from `info_cluster` to `pspartition`.
