# pawabot
The repository for my Telegram Bot.

This bot provides a command to search for torrents on the web, and let you select them for download.
There is a basic permission system allowing to manage multiple users for one bot.

Soon you'll be able to use it as well with
```
pip install pawabot
pawabot create-admin USERNAME ID
BOT_TOKEN=tooookeeeen pawabot run
```
