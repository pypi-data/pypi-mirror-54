    .. Methods:
        - generate_filter: apply the filter to the given list of scans
        - json_format: returns the filter as a dictionary

    The advanced search creates a complex query to the database and is a
    combination of several "query lines" which
    are linked with AND or OR and all composed of:
    - A negation or not
    - A tag name or all visible tags
    - A condition (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, CONTAINS, IN, BETWEEN)
    - A value

    :param values: list of values
    :param fields: list of list of fields
