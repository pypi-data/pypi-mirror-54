        #Packaging
        Packaging for this module is tricky, because it requires a spacy _model_ (e.g. `en_core_web_sm`) to work properly.
        To create a new release & push package to PyPI:
        1. Change the version number in `setup()` in `setup.py`
        2. Delete any old .whl or .tar.gz files in `dist` folder
        3. In your dev environment, run `python setup.py clean --all sdist bdist_wheel`
        4. Test upload to TestPyPI: `python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*`
        5. In a clean, new environment, verify that package downloaded from TestPyPI is working: `pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi pn-phrase-pickers`
        6. Upload to PyPI with twine.
