Define and retrieve (accurate) semantic poses in a 2D environment. This version is a workaround for some not yet available features of the OpenAPI Specification v3.0 (e.g. &#x60;anyOf&#x60; as a response type and adding a  &#x60;discriminator&#x60; for supporting polymorphism/composition). Therefore, ATM the sub-components BasicPose and InaccuratePose are reference objects inside their respective parent model.    # noqa: E501
