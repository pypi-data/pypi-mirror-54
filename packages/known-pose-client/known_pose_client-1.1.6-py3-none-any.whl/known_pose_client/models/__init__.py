    Known Pose API

    Define and retrieve (accurate) semantic poses in a 2D environment. This version is a workaround for some not yet available features of the OpenAPI Specification v3.0 (e.g. `anyOf` as a response type and adding a  `discriminator` for supporting polymorphism/composition). Therefore, ATM the sub-components BasicPose and InaccuratePose are reference objects inside their respective parent model.    # noqa: E501

    The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.1.0
